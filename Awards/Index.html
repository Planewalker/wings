  I've always sort of had mixed emotions about seeing web awards on other sites.  First off, it kind of seems like
  bragging;  "Lookie at what I gots me!" and all that.  Sure, I'll admit that most sites deserve most of those awards,
  but still...  Which kind of leads into the second thing I felt - jealousy.  What did they have that I didn't?  (This
  question became even more valid after I redesigned this site into its current form.)

  But now, I get to join the ranks of the awarded and cause others to continue to feel as I did.  :)  I don't know how
  much worth these have in the long run, or to you (the current web viewer), but here they are.  They at least make me
  feel better.

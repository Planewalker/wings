An archive of On the Wings of Mephits
-------------------------------------
On the Wings of Mephits is an old old site - from 1998. It was built by Ken Lipka
and in 2013 was gifted to Planewalker.com for archival purposes after hosting and
maintaining the site was no longer possible for Ken. Wings continues on Planewalker
available at wings.planewalker.com.

" Who's this? Another visitor to my hall of books? Well, fellow biblophile,
don't just stand there, come in! The door isn't locked. Please, make yourself 
at home. There are some chairs over there for you to sit in. You might want 
to drag them closer to the light to make the reading easier. The books are 
through those doors over there. Oh, and as long as you're up, would you mind 
getting me a refill for my pipe? Thank you. I would get it myself, but I only 
just sat down a few moments before you got here. I'm also feeling rather tired 
of late. Oh, and as you can see, I'm right in the middle of dictating some 
wonderful new stories I overheard.

Before I begin to direct you around my humble home, I suppose that some 
introductions are in order. These web pages over which I cast my watchful eyes 
are collectively known as The Planescape Fiction Archive. They are home to 
every known piece of fan fiction that is set in the PLANESCAPE campaign world. 
If you would like to know more about PLANESCAPE, I suggest you visit our father 
site, On the Wings of Mephits.... You can look down at the bottom of this page 
for the link. As for me, I am mephit. My name is Smogarentio de la Conjestico, 
Stealer of Breath, Inflicter of Allergies, Author Extrodinaire, and richest of 
all Smoke Mephits! "

  Who's this?  Another visitor to my hall of books?  Well, fellow biblophile, don't just stand there, come in!  The
  door isn't locked.  Please, make yourself at home.  There are some chairs over there for you to sit in.  You might
  want to drag them closer to the light to make the reading easier.  The books are through those doors over there.
  Oh, and as long as you're up, would you mind getting me a refill for my pipe?  Thank you.  I would get it myself,
  but I only just sat down a few moments before you got here.  I'm also feeling rather tired of late.  Oh, and as you
  can see, I'm right in the middle of dictating some wonderful new stories I overheard.
</p><p>
  Before I begin to direct you around my humble home, I suppose that some introductions are in order.  These web pages
  over which I cast my watchful eyes are collectively known as <i>The Planescape Fiction Archive</i>.  They are home to
  every known piece of fan fiction that is set in the PLANESCAPE campaign world.  If you would like to know more about
  PLANESCAPE, I suggest you visit our father site, <i>On the Wings of Mephits...</i>.  You can look down at the bottom
  of this page for the link.  As for me, I am mephit.  My name is Smogarentio de la Conjestico, Stealer of Breath,
  Inflicter of Allergies, Author Extrodinaire, and richest of all Smoke Mephits!  <font color="663300">*AHEM*</font>
  Oh.  Yes.  And that rodent in the corner is my lowly assistant, Nib.
</p><p>
  Now where was I?  Ah, yes.  The fiction.  It is so wonderful to have a fellow lover of the printed word come and visit
  me.  In fact, I'd so love it if you would come over here and shake my hand. I'd get up to greet you, but my back has been
  acting up recently.  Ah, you're so kind.  Unfortunately, I have just so many things to attend to, that I really can't
  take the time to show you around personally.  Nib, why don't you take a break and take care of our visitor?
</p></font>
<font face="Arial" color="663300"><p>
  Of course.  Certainly, Mr. Conjestico.  If you would follow me, please?
</p><p>
  Now that we're away from that blowhard, I can give you the true chant.  That smoke mephit over there doesn't do a single
  whisker of work around here.  I know that his kind are supposed to be lazy, but he's nearly beyond Hercules' Pillar.
  Do you realize that he hasn't been out of that chair in over a year?  I'd wish a good, strong wind would come along
  and disperse him.  Anyway, since I'm the one that has to do everything here, I really know my way around.  Allow me to
  give you the guided tour to the contents of these pages...

  This is the place where <u>I</u> write notes to keep track of what's changed or been added recently in these
  pages.  It's also something of a courtesy to visitors such as yourself.  By writing things in big letters on the
  wall behind our resident case of lung conjestion, it will save you the trouble of listening to him pretend to know
  what's going on and then eventually asking me to tell you what's new.  Trust me, the less you have to deal with the
  mephit, the better.

<br><font face="Arial" color="663300">
  This vast room represents the bulk of our collection of Planescape related fiction.  (Well, it's actually <u>my</u>
  collection if the truth is to be told.  Vapor-boy over there has only the vaguest notion of what stories are kept on
  the shelves.  Heck, I doubt he'd recognize one of our stories even if it fell on his head.  Hmmm... I think I'll test
  that theory later.) Each shelf holds the work of a multitude of authors.  The most popular story is a copy of what is
  probably the first, and definitely the most sought-after and well-known, piece of fiction - <i><b>Fire and Dust</b></i>.
  It's usually what people are looking for when they come here. Unfortunately, it seems that nearly all of the authors
  whose work we host are wandering bards.  They are constantly on the move, so we never know quite when we'll get a new
  story from them.  Also, some of them have moved so far Out of Touch that we no longer know how to contact them.  The
  stories of these authors shall remain here as something of a tribute to an era of by-gone inspiration.

  This hallway and its numerous archways represent the other service that our home provides.  For a wide variety of
  reasons, we are not able to own copies of every single piece of Planescape fiction that exists.  But, I'm not going
  to let that stop anyone from reading the things.  I've managed to create portals to each of these distant works so
  that they are still accessible and known to the general public.  (Yes, that's right, I said 'create'.  Don't ask how.
  I'm a mouse; I can get into anything.  Let's just leave it at that.)  Hopefully, as time goes by, I'll be able to
  convince their current owners to allow me to set aside shelf space for them in the Main Chamber.

  This portion of our library is something of an experiment.  I assume you've all heard the expression "one picture is
  worth a thousand words"?  Well, the walls of this chamber attempt to prove that.  I've recently gotten a hold of some
  original artwork and, lacking a better place to put it, decided to spruce up the dusty shelves a bit with some visual
  fiction.  I hope you don't mind my initiative - Smogarentio certainly doesn't (it's one less thing he has to ignore
  around here).

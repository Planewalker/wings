	*CRASH*  The sound of breaking glass signified Krax's
entrance.  I shook my head in sadness.  He's still a namer in the
Faction and thus hasn't figured out that being odd is not the same
as being one with Chaos.  Granted, he used the skylight this time -
I didn't expect that since I knew Krax was afraid of heights.  A
rather amusing trait in a Wind Duke, eh?
</p><p align=left>
	Looking around my bar, I breathed in the delicious Chaos
that I have created and sown.  This week, I moved my bar into a
crumbling, three-story building - perfect excuse to string up that
rigging we stole from the Primes last year.  A spider's nest, yes
that's the image I've created.  I love how my art comes unplanned
and randomly; I suppose that's why I joined in the first place.
</p><p align=left>
	It's still early; not many customers yet.  Krax had limped
over to the end of the current bar - a pile of crates - and was
busily slurping down some of the rotgut I kept for the normals.
Odd that one who claims to be nobility has no taste.  Terrin was
already moving through the bar, serving drinks and collecting
cast-off bits of clothing.  I wonder how long it will be before
that's no longer a thrill and she starts taking it off the
customers?  The only other regular at this hour is Purple - the
kobold shaman.  While he doesn't seem to feel particularly 
attracted to Chaos, his "sermons" always cause some confusion.
I like him.  Perhaps I should bring him to the Hive tonight and
let the others bring him into the faction.
</p><p align=left>
	Other than those, I've only a smattering of customers.
A thri-kreen and pixie are engaged in a deep philosophical 
conversation about desserts (I think); a Sensate is settling into
the crow's nest in the broken roof, cup in hand; and a Rogue Modron
has just come in.  Now *THIS* is going to be fun.  It's shaping up
to be another night of pleasent Chaos here at what the normals
call "Quake Lavender's Place".  I just call it mine.  But else
do you want from a Xoasitect?

**[Sir Twist]**
</p><p align=left>
Measure Three Narthe moved down the street towards the Hive. {I'm going to
have that place closed tonight}, the Hardhead thought to himself.  {That whole
house of barmies is either going to the Red Death or the Bleakers...or I'll
have to do it myself.} Tonight was going to be his jump to Mover status.
</p><p align=left>
There was the Shattered Temple, it was only ten more minutes from here.
{Damn berks, those Athar. Stirring up trouble with the priests, ain't got no
sense of order, they don't.} Caught up in his thoughts, Narthe failed to
realise where he was going -- {Hey! I don't remember this corner being here!}
He grabbed the colalr of a bubber that was staggering down the lane.
</p><p align=left>
"Hey, you. Hang on a second, bubber. You know where Quake's is?"
</p><p align=left>
The bleary-eyed drunkard looked him up and down. "You a Harmonium basher?"
</p><p align=left>
"Yeah, I'm Measure Three Narthe, and I won't arrest you for appearing
under the influence of an intoxicating substance if you show me the way to
Quake's," Narthe threatened.
</p><p align=left>
A look of fear crossed the old bub's face. "It's down that way." He
pointed. "I think...I'm not sure where Quake's moved into tonight...#hiccup#...
maybe she took his bar over that way..."
</p><p align=left>
Narthe dropped him ungraciously and walked on. The chill was getting to
him, and he wrapped his cloak closer around him. Ahead he saw purple light
from around the corner. He slowed his pace, drew his blade and cautiously
approached the corner.
</p><p align=left>
It was a gathering of Xaositec heathens. Great, that's all I need, he
fumed to himself. Normally, he would have gone right in there and broken
the thing right up. But tonight, he had a mission. He hated to do it this
way, but it seemed he had no choice. Sheathing his longsword, he wrapped
his cloak around him, hiding the Harmonium badge and red armour and edged
around the crowd.
</p><p align=left>
Ah, luck was with him tonight! Ahead was the block where Quake usually
kept her kip. He let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding and
moved forward. Tonight, Quake would make an appearance at the prison. He
stood a few yards from the doorway for a second and drew his blade. He
checked his belt for the warrant he'd managed to weasel from the -- hey!
where was that darned scroll? He searched the rest of his clothing to no
avail. Damn, it must have been that sodding bubber. Oh well, he'd have to
do this without. The law was with him, anyway.
</p><p align=left>
He stepped forward and felt a large pain on the back of his neck. The last
thing he remembered was seeing a face framed in long hair and a tatoo over
a red eye, and he thought he saw horns...
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
**[Shelaam]**
</p><p align=left>
From behind the glass I was polishing, I sized up the modron as it
hesitantly entered the bar, scanning the place with its large round eyes,
one of which was surrounded by a thick circle of black paint. Predictably
ill at ease here (if anything is predictable), from the looks of if the
law-beast was a courier, with what seemed like hundreds of small gray
pouches hanging off baldrics encircling its chunky, cubic body, covering it
like a dusky tunic. One of its small wings gave a flap now and then, as if
nervously encouraging the modron to take care of its business and be gone.
</p><p align=left>
After taking its measure of Quake's, the courier strode over to Purple.
They sat in hushed conversation for a few minutes, the kobold even waving
me away when I raised an eyebrow to see if they wanted some bub. Whatever
darks they were exchanging, I couldn't help thinking that the conversation
would be better suited to somewhere other than the middle of a bub-house
where the loudest sound was the Sensate trying to determine whether
gargling the dregs of his firewine would cure a throat infection. From the
look on Purple's face, he agreed with me, but soon the muffled conversation
ceased and the modron reached into one of its small pouches.
</p><p align=left>
And that's when I got the feeling. Krax looked up from his rotgut with a
grin and a gleam in his eye, obviously feeling it too. Perhaps the lad had
some potential after all. Meanwhile, the law-beast hadn't found what it was
looking for, and was searching other pouches, getting more frantic by the
second.
</p><p align=left>
Setting down the now spotless glass, I sauntered over to the pair, who were
by now engrossed in the erstwhile courier's apparent inability to find what
he was looking for. "Perhaps I may be of assistance", I said, slipping my
hand deftly into a random pouch and withdrawing a large ruby, the rich
colour of blood and cut in an unusual manner.
</p><p align=left>
With a whirr, the modron spun to face me, its eyes visibly shrinking as it
focused of the ruby in my hand. Perhaps it had spent time in the Hive,
because it didn't wait to parley, just reached beneath the plethora of gray
pouches to withdraw a wickedly sharp looking chiv. Unfortunately for the
courier, its tight focus on the gem in my hand made it oblivious to an
important factor which held great promise of defusing this little situation
before it got out of hand. 
</p><p align=left>
From the corner of my eye, I detected the Sensate, already deep in his cups
after a long afternoon on the bub, reaching for the length of rigging he'd
used half an hour ago to swing from the crows nest straight to the bar for
me to pour him another.

**[Kris Mckinnon]**
</p><p align=left>
So, I took a deep breath of Sigil's smoggy air and smiled deeply. After so
many hours of thinking, of painting, of agonizing over the angles of the
giant pink spines in my sculptures, I had finally made it through his last
showing of the season at Lazz's School of Vivid Unpleasantness. I could
hardly contain my excitement. A whole two weeks with no instructors and no
examinations. Complete freedom. Now I just had to find some place to waste
it all in.
</p><p align=left>
"What about this one bloods?" I said, pointing to a crumbling, three story
building off to the right of the street. It seemed to be abandoned, but the
crows nest poking through the top of the roof also spoke hope of something
interesting. Maybe a prime had finally figured out how gate in something as
large as the ships that sailed the oceans of the Planes. If he had, this
was evidence that not all spells worked out as planned. Besides, I could
see light streaming out from the cracks in the masonry If there was light
in this part of Sigil, there would probably be some kind of alcohol as
well. I turned to take in my accomplices, errr ... companions expressions.
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, its simply -charming-" squealed Davidia, her eyes containing her usual
amount of enthusiasm for anything at all. "Its all crumbly and old and it
looks like it belongs in the middle of the Hive! It might have brigands
inside! Or maybe even Anarchists!" She knelt down and shivered against
'Eggy', her paramour, for the last few weeks at least. The painters had a
running pool on how long it would last. I had taken the 4 week slot, hoping
that the height difference would prove an insurmountable barrier for their
bodies to overcome. .
</p><p align=left>
So far, my hope had been fading fast. So had that of the student who's room
was underneath hers. He's been begging for structural reinforcement ever
since she managed to get into the interpretive dance class. When she
started letting 'Eggy' visit her at night, he became even more nervous. But
his symphonies have suddenly gotten a great beat. Much more, shall we say,
martial than the swooping stuff he played before. I guess seeing the beams
bend back and forth above you while you work concentrates the mind.
</p><p align=left>
To say she's a strapping lady is an understatement by about two hundred
pounds and 3 feet. I guess that's what happens from having a hill giant as
a mother. But she handles a paint brush like nobodies business, she's good
at arm wrestling and she shares the beers she wins. That's good enough in
my book.
</p><p align=left>
Her arms tightened around 'Eggy''s chest, causing him to gag and turn red.
"Will you keep me from their vile clutches, Eggy my sweet?" She cooed into
his ear, unaware of his growing lack of oxygen.
</p><p align=left>
"Urgh!" 'Eggy' said intelligently, his legs straining to reattach
themselves to the slime filed gutter, although I wouldn't know why anyone
would want to stand in that muck of their own free will. Prince Thorbaldin
the Third, King of the Mountains, heir apparent to the Silver Mines of the
Thorbaldin Clan, slowly levered his arm in between Davidias massive ones
and broke her friendly, but asphyxiating, embrace. As he stepped back
gasping, he adjusted his battered helm and tugged on his beard in that
particular habit of his. He said he learned it from his father, but I think
its just a way to make his beard grow further. As if he needs it. The thing
is already over his shoulder. But anyone who came to Lazz's from the Prime
to learn new ways of metal engraving had to be a bit touched in the head
anyway. That's all right, we get along anyway.
</p><p align=left>
"Urrr." He said in that gravely voice of his. "Urrr.. yeah." As you can
see, he's a talker. After a moment, he patted Davidias lower leg
comfortingly. She in turn smiled at him again, and reached down to give him
another hug, or just carry him around for a while. I've seen that a couple
of times and well, it puts me in mind of a good hour of laughs. He seems to
enjoy it when no one else is around though, and it's sweet the way he
braids her hair. Most people stifle their humor though, when they see the
size of 'Eggy's axe. This time he must of thought that being carted through
the hive like a fuzzy cat a bit too much affection for his taste, because
he took off towards the building as fast as his stoic little legs could
carry him.
</p><p align=left>
Taking that as a yes, I strode across the road behind him with the intent
of finding something to drink, with Davidia tromping gently behind me. My
hooves made little tap taping sounds on the hard paving stones that lay
scattered in the road here and there. As I approached the bar, well, what I
-hoped- was a bar, I saw a few shadowy figures sitting inside. Most of them
seemed to be holding containers of some kind. A good sign. I hoped it
wasn't a Lower/Upper-Planes-Only kind of kip. Considering my ancestry, I
could probably stand whatever kind of brew they served, but Davidia gets a
bit bubbed after her seventh glass. And 'Eggy', well 'Eggy' starts singing
after the fourth. I try to be drunk by then if I can help it. It makes the
cries of "Me homeland!" and the crashing glass much easier to bear.
</p><p align=left>
'Eggy' waited for us at the entrance to the bar. I grabbed the door over
his head and pushed it open. I intended to get in a good couple of drinks
before any trouble, but as it was trouble came looking for me first. As I
opened the door I heard the unmistakable thud of flesh meeting metal in an
uncompromising fashion (please don't ask). Then I saw a crazily dressed
figure swinging from a rope complete his inadvertent meeting with the gray
cube of metal known as a modron. The blow knocked the bubber from his feet,
and sent the modron flying backwards in what promised to be a spectacular
ending to the floor show. Unfortunately, I happened to be standing in his
landing spot.
</p><p align=left>
I caught a glimpse of hundreds of small pouches flying from its cubic body
before it smashed into me, driving me off my feet. I was better off than
the modron, who continued his flight over my head and out into the night,
taking the door along with him in his exploration of the gutter. I heard a
crash as the Modron hit the pavement. I winced in sympathy from my sprawl
on the floor. That sounded like it hurt. I got quickly to my feet (cloven
hooves are handy for that, something about being a tiefling that half makes
up for the red skin and vestigial horns), straightened my clothes making
sure that the black hadn't collected too much dust on its trip and looked
up for the bar. Behind me, I felt the floor creak as Davidia came in behind
me.
</p><p align=left>
"Wasn't that exciting! Did you see it?" She said happily, but I was too
busy to respond. I scanned the room for what would pass for a bar. I'd find
something potable in here, or my name wasn't Eduardo de Laurentia, future
portraiteer to the Stars.

</p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, Licksy the Pixie watched the incident with a wide grin.  The
thri-keen was beginning to bore him with all this talk about dessert. 
Something much more interesting was happening at another table:  Quake had
taken a gem from a rogue modron, and then the modron drew his weapon. 
(That githzerai was always getting herself into trouble, bothering the
customers).  Suddenly, a drunken Sensate swung on a rope and crashed into
Quake and the modron.  The gem fell out of her hand and skittered across the floor. 
</p><p align=left> 
Bar brawl! Krax, Terrin, Purple, Quake, the Sensate -- all
rushing to reach the huge precious gem.  Only to see Licksy the Pixie fly
down on silver wings and grab it for himself.  Tittering, the sprite flew
out the door. 
</p><p align=left>
Licksy looked behind to see KK, the bouncer, who was perched atop the
doorway and looking out for unwanted customers.  KK obviously had no idea
of what had happened inside.
</p><p align=left> 
As he fluttered down the street, Licksy examined the gem closely and
almost dropped it in surprise.
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[John Gonzalez]**
</p><p align=left>
'What was that?!?' the flying pixie thought to himself, 'How 
interesting.'. Not only did the large red bauble feel hot and cold at 
the same time but there seemed to be something moving within. 'A 
face? Is it smiling at me?'
</p><p align=left>
So intent was the pixie's concentation upon the jewel, that he failed 
to notice the street spanning arch, apropriately covered with soot 
and razorvines.
</p><p align=left>
".......ouch........"
</p><p align=left>
Walking home from the soup kitchen, Pug was deep in a depressed 
reverie when he heard the clatter of a gemstone drop at his feet
"Wot's this?" the orc exclaims to himself as he picks up the red gem 
and looks around. Seeing noone in the vicinity, Pug nonchalantly 
drops the jewel in his threadbare coat pocket and ambles on down the 
street.
</p><p align=left>
A minute goes by under the archway, all fairly routine in the life of 
an archway in this part of Sigil, when a decidely more battered and 
bruised Licksy drops from the tangle of razorvine and adds a slight 
moan to the silence.
</p><p align=left>
Several paces away from the downed pixie, a jangled, clicking 
whirring noise begins.  Followed quickly after by the louder clanging 
of a blocky shape raising itself to it's main locomotion appendages.
Tertiary Secter Unit Surface Embelleshment Remover, or more commonly 
referred to as 'Tim', scanned the area of the darkened street.  The 
red hued crystalline object was apparently not in the immediate 
vicinity.  "12h + 4x/infinity=bartender must have it." observed Tim.
Tim began to move back to the bar, grabbing the various pouches and 
items that had been strewn about in his chaotic flight from the 
ramshackled dive. ' The unit comprised of mostly water and some carbon 
elements would pay.' thought Tim.

**[Avi]**
</p><p align=left>
Imagine you are looking down upon the Lady's Ward.  Focus on the Prison,
headquarters of the Mercykillers, a massive fortress of solid stone and
jutting spikes that casts a shadow of cold justice.  Travellers walk past
it in shame, shoulders cringed, their guilts laid bare before them. 
 </p><p align=left>
Pass through the grim exterior and into the structure's innards of dark
hallways and cold cells.  Mercykillers patrol the tunnels, forever
vigilant.  Prisoners squat in their corners like the scum of the earth. 
 </p><p align=left>
Descend to a small room in the bowels of the fortress.  Here sits a
hulking mass of shadows.  Huge dark hands flip through piles of papers on
a desk.  The creature pauses, charcoal eyes focusing on a piece of writing
titled "A Night at Quake's".  The thing rumbles, "Quake, Krax, Terrin,
thri-keen, Licksy, Purple, Sensate, Rogue Modron, KK, Narthe, Davidia,
Eggy, Eduardo, Pug.... too many characters!" 
 </p><p align=left>
The shadowy hulk rises from the desk, its head brushing the ceiling, and
grabs an enormous adamantine battle-axe.  Then it strides out of the
office, taking some of the doorframe with it. 
 </p><p align=left>
The room seems to breath easier now that the shadowy presence has left. 
Now, the office is quite empty -- except for the desk, the chair, and a
golden plaque hanging on the wall, upon which are engraved the words: 
Mercykiller Award of Excellence. For a Lifetime Achievment of Perfection.
Gargan Necksplitter: Official Executioner of Unessential Story Characters. 
 </p><p align=left>
The news quickly hits the streets: Gargan is on the move.  Which means
that somebody is writing a Sigil-based story with too many characters. 
Suddenly everybody fears for their lives, everyone from the lowest street
urchin to the greatest celestial.  Horse-drawn carriages speed away,
pedestrians crowd into the nearest public building, families rush into
their homes and lock the doors and windows.  Gargan marches down deserted
streets. 
 </p><p align=left>
The executioner strides down Yeoman Street towards Quake's tavern, always
following the story plot, sniffing out for unessential characters.  He
senses nothing in this part of Sigil. 
 </p><p align=left>
According to hearsay, the shadow hulk is capable of slaying anything no
matter how physically or magically powerful.  Only two things provide
protection from a Story Character Executioner: importance or anonymity.
Gargan won't execute interesting story characters who are somehow
essential in the scheme of things.  Anonymous characters are part of the
story setting and don't qualify as true characters. 
 </p><p align=left>
A man named Bob dwells at 37 Yeoman Street.  A moment ago, he was an
anonymous character, thus undetectable to Gargan.  I have now converted
him to a foreground character.  Bob is boring and has no bearing
whatsoever on this story. 
 </p><p align=left>
Gargan stops in mid-stride, ears perked.  He pivots around and backtracks
towards 37 Yeoman.  His shadowy visage deepens into night, charcoal eyes
burning out the light.  The door to the house shatters as Gargan strolls
through it.  Bob gawks at the approaching menace, curses the moment he
became a character, and dies when the axe descends upon his neck. 
 </p><p align=left>
The Story Character Executioner grins savagely, displaying ebony teeth.  
He makes his way, once again, towards Quake's tavern.
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Ken Lipka]**
</p><p align=left>
After Gargan leaves, there is silence, save for the dripping of blood
from the severed neck of Bob.  Then, some one else enters the room.
This figure is only a mere shadow, a hint of a presence, yet it can most
definitely be felt.  The shadow-man moves over to the corpse of Bob,
and carefully, almost tenderly, places the head back on the body.  A
wave of it's inky black hand and a golden light glows across the cut.
After a moment, the wound is healed, and Bob begins to breathe again.
</p><p align=left>
The shadow quickly leaves the dwelling, knowing that Bob will once
again be free to resume his anonymous life - and will think of Gargan's
visit as nothing more than a nightmare.  Why does miracle come to pass?
For this shadow of man is The Scribe.  The Scribe is the high priest of
the Temple of the Script.  It is his duty to make sure that the
integrity of the Script of Life is mantained and not prematurely
compromised.  The Scribe has forseen that Bob is not as anonymous as
Gargan assumes.  He also knows that his powers will be needed again in
the future.
</p><p align=left>
But for now, The Scribe is content to watch and wait.  After all,
there are times when Gargan is right.

**[Kris Mckinnon]**
</p><p align=left>
I started to like the place about the same time that I got to the bar.
Admittedly, my first impression had been tainted by the fact it had taken
place upside down on the floor. Not that I don't spend some time like that
in the more lower class bubberies in Sigil, but it usually takes me more
than no drinks to end up there. But Quake changed my impressions about the
same time she poured me three tall ales and charged me two of my sterling
silver buttons for it. Gods, I love Xaosmen bartenders. Especially when
they pour the good stuff for that little. Although it depends a lot on
their mood. I'll have 'Eggy' buy the next round, just in case. I glanced
backwards, making sure that Davidia and him had found a seat. 
</p><p align=left>
Davidia was cramming herself into a corner formed by bunches of clothes and
boxes heaped together in a manner that reminded me of a some kind of
demented market display. The barmaid, who seemed to be eyeing my black
tunic with something approaching obsession, seemed a bit upset that Davidia
chose to use them as a back rest, but then shrugged and moved off to
another part of the bar. Eggy sat in her lap, glaring around at everyone who
looked their way. Funny, no one seemed inclined to make comments. I wonder
why. 
</p><p align=left>
As I brought the three drinks ('Eggy's in a bucket, Davidias in a
thimble.  And no, they don't usually switch drinks, 'Eggy' is a dwarf after
all) I checked out the other bloods in the tavern. A thri-kreen was sitting
in the corner, looking forlornly out the door and holding what looked to be
a recipe in one clawed hand. The Sensate that had caused my close
relationship with the floor had returned, somewhat groggily to his seat in
the crows nest. Looked like a pretty slow night, all told. Then my boot hit
a small pouch that lay on the floor. Funny, it didn't look like something
that would lay around in Quakes for long. Xaosmen are notorious for
collecting the barmiest junk. Well, most of the time anyway. 
</p><p align=left>
Curious I stopped for a second and picked it up, tossing it in one hand as
I made my way to where my companions were sitting. Davidia and 'Eggy' broke
off their intimate talking and the occasional "Hur hur hur" when I passed
them their bub. Davidia sipped daintily at hers for a moment then set it
down, looking down at the pouch with interest when I put it down in the
middle of the table. 
</p><p align=left>
"Whats that darling little pouch doing?" She asked, as she poked at it with
her little finger. "Oh look, its come open already." 
</p><p align=left>
I shrugged, not knowing much more then her. Just then 'Eggys' eyes narrowed
and his nostrils widened as he sniffed the air. I knew that look. 'Eggy'
had found the one thing that he liked more than Davidia. 
</p><p align=left>
"Gold." He announced. "There's gold in that pouch." I looked at him in
amazement. 'Eggy's family had a nose for gold since ages past. Its one of
the reasons he could afford the mithril axe he kept so carefully blackened
up in town. 
</p><p align=left>
Without pausing, he grabbed the pouch and turned it upside down on the
table spilling gold coins all over the table. While the noise level in the
Tavern dramatically decreased he carefully picked up all of the gold and
ran his fingers through it, relishing the feel. 
</p><p align=left>
"You dwarves really do love gold, don't you." I remarked to him. 
</p><p align=left>
"Of course not." He replied, still keeping his gaze on the gold. "We just
say that to get it to come home with us."
</p><p align=left>
I leaned back in my chair and took a long pull of my bub, rolling this
pearl of Dwarvish wisdom while the cool ale slid down my throat. Suddenly
my reflection was broken by the crash of someone hitting the floor hard. I
turned around to see the thri-kreen scuttling out the door as fast as his
four legs could carry him. I was surprised that the bouncer didn't grab him
on the way out, but that was explained when a huge shadow loomed through
the front door and someone yelled "Gargan!"
</p><p align=left>
The ale spewed from my throat and splashed towards Davidias sandals, but
she didn't pay attention, as she was too busy trying to hide under the table with
'Eggy' in close pursuit. His face was pure white and I gathered from his
shocked look at me that mine was about the same shade. 
</p><p align=left>
I cursed myself as I crawled underneath the table and tried to hide the
best I could, which was not very well considering the space was somewhat
occupied by Davidias bulk. Of all the times to go drinking without my non-
partisan story arc! I had heard Gargan was on the prowl, but I hadn't even
gone back to pick it up. My heart pounded as the shadow moved forward and
huge feet came into view. 
</p><p align=left>
I scrabbled deperately for something, anything that would render my
existance in this story more than a cheap excuse to make fun of artists. I
patted my belt pouch frantically. Damm it to the Abyss! Nothing in them
except for a risque sketch of a tiefling I knew long ago. The story hadn't
degenerated to the point where that would work. Deperately I reached for
the pouch that Eggy had dropped in his haste to crawl under the table. My
fingers felt some kind of lump inside. There must be something else in the
pouch, something that might interest enough people that Gargans axe
wouldn't find my neck a tempting target. I shut my eyes, turned the pouch
upside down and shook it, praying for an interesting sound.

**[Mr. Niceguy]**
</p><p align=left>
Bob woke up slowly, his neck aching like a herd of maelephants had
been dancing the macarena on it.  What a strange dream he'd had...
</p><p align=left>
"Wait a minute!," shouted Bob.  "That was no dream!  That was Gargan,
the Story-killer!  And he was on his way over to Quake's!"
</p><p align=left>
"Well, he'll soon regret having messed with me!!  No one tries to can
*me* and lives!  He'll rue the day he ever met Baker Bob, King of the
Hot-Cross-Bun-Trade!"  Bob's unnecessary exposition continued for a good
five minutes before he wound down, muttering, "Call me an unimportant,
insignificant character, will he?"
</p><p align=left>
With that, Baker Bob grabbed his best taffeta gown and slammed his
razorvine chef's hat down on his head.  He stormed into his kitchen
while adjusting his 6-inch spike heels, and reached up for the *special*
pie formula, the one with the magically acidic poision that he saved for 
Tanar'ri retirement parties.  The one marked "Lethally Dangerous" and
"Do Not Touch Except In Extreme Emergencies."
</p><p align=left>
He gathered together the rest of the ingredients, extra helpings for
each just in case, and piled the whole mess into his Wondrous Hot Pot
and Toaster Oven of Holding.  Gargan was going to discover just how
dangerous it was to encounter Baker Bob with a bun in the oven.
</p><p align=left>
Finally Bob called out to his fire mephit wait-staff:  "Larry! Moe!
Curly! Shemp! Curly-Joe!  We've got a rush order at Quake's!  Get over
here and let's get cookin'!"
</p><p align=left>
The mephits piled into the Toaster Oven and started heating up the
first pie.  Curly-Joe got a bad whiff though, and fell out stone-cold
dead before the pie could be set on insta-auto-bake.  The other mephits
quickly decided to leaven the recipe of the other pies with flatulence
powder, but were too scared of the dreaded Bob to tell him.
</p><p align=left>
With the first pie piping fresh from the insta-auto-bake in his hand,
Bob wheeled the Hot Pot and Toaster Oven over to his stove, where he
pushed the whole business through before following himself.  Once
inside, he activated the gate to Quake's oven by humming the first few
bars of 'Pat-a-cake, Pat-a-cake.'
</p><p align=left>
At Quake's, the oven exploded in a furious roar.  Baker Bob was ready
for action!  He slipped around the door to the bar and told his mephits
to "Keep Baking!  You never know how these things'll work out!"
</p><p align=left>
In the bar itself, Bob had no trouble spotting Gargan.  The massive
brute was holding a tiefling upside down by one hoofed leg, and was
cocking his axe back for a mighty cleaving.
</p><p align=left>
The tiefling, about to be split asunder in a most unpleasant manner,
was looking forlornly at the 'Mr. Stiffy's Manliness Enhancer' which had
apparently fallen out of his pouch onto the ground.  He face said that
if the axe-blow didn't kill him, embarrassment might.
</p><p align=left>
Bob leapt to the top of the bar, knocking cheap peanuts and stale
pretzels into the drinks of half the patrons.  His stiletto heels danced
around a drunk's hand in a quick game of mumblety-peg.  "Hey, Gargan!"
he shouted.  "Save room for dessert!"
</p><p align=left>
Gargan half turned to look at the interruption, a slow scowl erasing
the joyful grin that had been anticipating the incipient deathblow.  
Both expressions were wiped off his face by the splattery cream pie that
squooshed right through the face-grate of his horned helmet.  He licked
his lips once, started to bellow in anger, and then stiffened like
Medusa's hairstylist.  
</p><p align=left>
The tiefling and Gargan's axe fell from his hands.  The tiefling
yelled "Timmmm-berrrr!" and leaped for cover.  The axe merely muttered,
"Oh, No, not Again!"  Gargan's only sound was the mighty 'Thump!' of his
unbreathing body hitting the ground.
</p><p align=left>
Baker Bob's eyes gleamed evilly, and in triumph.  He quickly wheeled a
hand-cart around the bar and rolled the massive corpse over onto it.
</p><p align=left>
"Don't worry folks, no danger left here," chirped Bob merrily.  Some
of the patrons were staring hard, not sure they were seeing what they
were seeing.  It wasn't every day the King-of-the-Hot-Cross-Bun-Trade
bounced into the bar and took down a bruiser like Gargan with one shot.
And besides, his heels clashed with his dress.
</p><p align=left>
"There'll be plenty of fresh baked Gargan Cakes, available for free,
coming in just a few moments, so everyone just stay in your seats,
please," said Bob.  He trundled the corpse into the kitchen, where
shouting was then heard.  "Look at all these pies!  I didn't ask for
this!  Get those out of here, and help me peel this berk out of his
armor.  I'm not going for barbecue, here!"
</p><p align=left>
KK looked over at Quake.  She shrugged, and gestured for him to go
help in the kitchen.  He never made it that far, because just then the
pies and the mephits came boiling out...

**[Matt M Oostman]**
</p><p align=left>
	*SPLORK!*
</p><p align=left>
	Mathais knew that sound all to well. He fumbled for his ~Glasses
of Neighbor Watching~ and peered through the wall into Quark's. Scanning
the room briefly, his eyes came to rest on a mound of mephits and goo,
completely covering another creature. "Hmm, I wonder what that is," he
pondered to himself. "I'll go find out!" he declared triumphantly as he
sat up and put on his pink bunny slippers. "And they told me I was drunk,
I couldn't even keep standing, they said," he mumbled while searching
for his component pouch. "Come on, Dreamweaver." He poked the snoozing
pseudo-dragon. "Oh, hurry up." <~~Not gonna happen, you had too many
Azful Berry Drinks~~> the half awake mini-dragon protested. "AHHH!"
Mathais shrieked, "I wish you could talk normal, you know telepathy gives
me a headache when I'm drunk." The elven mage grabbed his companion, set
him on his shoulder, and set out down the darkened hotel steps. 
</p><p align=left>
	Upon his stumbling arrival at the door, he promptly tripped over
his own feet and landed just outside the door in the center of a ring
of out of work light boys. They all had the same idea as they stared at
the ~Ring of Continual Light~ upon the finger of the sprawled mage. "Hey,
who, or what, are you?" the leader asked the heap of tangled robes. "I'm
drunk off my ass! Who are you?" he replied, dusting himself off and
straightening his belongings. "I'm Northnik, and you're giving me that
ring" the second one answered. "I don't think so, I'm a very powerful
mage. Now back off, or I'll test my newest spell" Mathais threatened.
"OOH!" the leaded remarked sarcastically, "what'da gonna do, cast Dufus'
Dangerous Dohicky?" "NO! Even better!" the elf announced "~Mathias
Mundane Macarana~!" As the band of ruffians struggled to control their
limbs, the elven mage began to dance as a band of Phantasmal Singers came
into existence behind him. "HAAAAAY MACARENA!" the light boys shouted as
the spell finally took effect.  <~~That'll handle them, but what about
me, It's area affect spell!~~> Mathais heard in his head. He quickly
learned his flaw in judgment as he saw the baby pseudo-dragon dancing away
on his shoulder. "Um, if ya can't beat 'em, join 'em?" he asked as the
spell finally griped it's caster as well. "At least it doesn't have
control of my legs," the mage stated. "Let's go!" 
</p><p align=left>
	Mathais hurriedly Macarena-ed his way into Quark's only to be
disturbed by Baker Bob as he chased Larry and Curly around the bar with
his platinum coated rolling pin. "Teach you to waste my pies!" the baker
fumed. "I've got you now" Suddenly he came to a halt. The baker could be
stopped by one thing and one thing only...........
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Mr. Niceguy]**
</p><p align=left>
....  And that thing, Gargan, had already been laid out flat on the
chopping block in Quake's kitchen.
</p><p align=left>
  Moe and Shemp, in between cranking out more pies, had stripped the
mighty Gargan down to his helmet (they weren't particularly eager for a
look at that ugly face) and his shorts.  The boxers were Gargan's
favorites, the ones with the pink hearts and the slogan 'Kiss me, I'm
Krynnish' printed on the seat.
</p><p align=left>
  Moe took the latest batch of pies out to Bob, hoping to save his
fellows from a good platinum-pin walloping, while Shemp continued work
on the Gargan Cakes.  Shemp, however, was the worst recipe-follower in
the Great Ring, as he had unknowingly proved earlier in the evening. 
And his mistake was about to come back to haunt him.
</p><p align=left>
  Shemp was garnishing Gargan with a light bearnaise sauce, a stuffed
radish or two, and some strategic dollops of whipped cream, when the
reason for the behemoth's lack of breath became apparent.  It wasn't
because he was dead; it was because he was filling with so much internal
gas that he no longer needed to breath!  The flatulence powder Shemp had
dumped into the mix must have gone mostly into that first deadly pie and
reacted with the magical acidic poison in some strange, unknown way!
</p><p align=left>
  A few rude noises escaped from some radish-impeded orifices and Gargan
started to inflate like a cheap carny balloon.
</p><p align=left>
  When Gargan became airborne, Shemp decided to call for help.  By this
time he was pretty sure that Gargan's eyes were bulging from rage more
than internal pressure, and he didn't want to be the sole target when
Gargan, er, exloded.
</p><p align=left>
  When Gargan grabbed his axe, Shemp decided to *run* for help.
</p><p align=left>
  However, Shemp's flight was stopped cold at the door to the bar; the
sight beyond was enough to give any mephit pause.
</p><p align=left>
  Mathais the Mage must've been d.w.i. again (drunk while incanting)
because the whole room was dancing around, not in Mathais' patented
(#346932-B, at the local Magician's Guild) Mundane Macarena, but in some
hideous mix of awful dance steps from across the ages.
</p><p align=left>
  Mathais, his mini-dragon Dreamweaver, and a gaggle of light boys were
indeed doing the Macarena in the bar's vestibule.
</p><p align=left>
  Bob, Larry, Curly, and Moe however, were bouncing around behind the
bar in a pathetic square dance, do-se-do'ing to the unseen beat of a
phantasmal caller.
</p><p align=left>
  Terrin the waitress and Purple the Kobold were slinking along between
tables in a heated version of 'La Bamba: The *Forbidden* Dance'.  Purple
was taking advantage of their height variances and would probably later
regret sticking his snout in where it didn't belong.
</p><p align=left>
  Eduardo, Eggy, and Davidia were strolling along in lock-stepped
imitation of Genesis's 'I Can't Dance' moves.  Where they had grabbed
the black sunglasses wasn't apparent.
</p><p align=left>
  The mysterioius thri-kreen was 'Walking Like an E-gyptian,'  Quake
herself was about to enter the final, wet throes of the famous
'Splashdance' scene, and Krax the Wind Duke and the Sensate were gyrating up in
the crow's nest in a way that suspiciously resembled the 'Disco Duck.'
</p><p align=left>
  Even the bar's horde of certifiably insane cranium rats had donned
their straightjackets and were high-stepping it out across the stage in
fine fashion to the strains of A Chorus Line's 'One'.
</p><p align=left>
  Only KK, the magically immune and imaginationally-impaired stone golem
bouncer, seemed not to be affected.
</p><p align=left>
  Shemp could feel his toes starting to move in a country line dance
kind of way, and screamed in horror, "Not the Achy Breaky!!!"  
</p><p align=left>
  Fortunately for Shemp, the author had always believed that 4 stooges
numbered one too many.  Shemp's pain was cut off along with his head, as
Gargan rocketed by, axe swinging.
</p><p align=left>
  Propelled by the purest internal combustion, Gargan buzzed the room
like a mad stinkbug.  The dancers all paused briefly to clip clothes
pins to their noses, and then returned to their steps.
</p><p align=left>
  All save the light boys, who collectively macarena'd for the door in
the sure knowledge that they were doomed if Gargan spotted them.
</p><p align=left>
  They were blocked in their flight by the return of Tertiary Sector
Unit Surface Embelleshment Remover, (more commonly known as 'Tim').  Tim
crashed through the door bellowing "Death to the units comprised of
mostly water and some carbon elements!"  Other obtuse threats followed,
strangely punctuated by Tim's final shout of, "Do the Hustle!"
</p><p align=left>
  The patrons all giggled in glee as Gargan's fading trajectory
putt-putt-putted him directly into the newly returned modron.  The two
straight men crashed together in a very tangled mess, and once again
pouches went flying across the room.
</p><p align=left>
  No one noticed that the one marked 'Do Not Disturb' had begun
ticking...
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Avi]**
</p><p align=left>
The Modron sat up, his mechanical face looking as angry as a mechancial
face can be.  "Again!  Why can't my pouches ever remain on my person!"  At
which point his highly sensitive satellite-dish ears picked up a ticking
sound from a fallen pouch.  Excellent, he thought to himself, I've always
wanted revenge.  Now I'll have it!  Better leave before the bomb goes off. 
 </p><p align=left>
Tim scrambled towards the door and hoped that KK's job was to prevent
unwanted customers from entering not leaving the bar.  But then a huge
shadowy hand grabbed the Modron and hauled him up.  Tim found himself
staring into the pitch-black eyes of Gargan Necksplitter. 
 </p><p align=left>
"I won't slay you, modron.  You're an interesting character," Gargan
rumbled.  Tim sighed in relief.  "You know," Gargan whined, "it's tough
being an executioner."  Tim was incredulous.  The shadow hulk continued,
"Ya, that's right.  Everybody is terrified of me, thinking I'm going to
slay them.  Thing is, my job is to threaten people, to whip up some
excitement..  You know?"  Tim nodded nervously.  Gargan wouldn't kill him,
which was all well and good, but that bomb would soon explode.  Yet he
couldn't break Gargan's grasp.  "I mean, I haven't actually had to kill
that often.  Most of the time, I scare people into being interesting and
then I go on my way." The modron gave a weak smile. "Anyway, I'll let you
go. Goodbye."  Tim fled. 
 </p><p align=left>
The patrons realized by now that Gargan was back in action.  The dancing
ceased.  A mixture of terrified silence and screams pervaded the inn.  The
shadow hulk ignored all but one patron -- Baker Bob.  He strode straight
towards the baker like a charging rhino.  Bob frantically looked around
for a weapon, but he had no poison pies this time. 
 </p><p align=left>
Gargan growled, "This is for giving me acid indigestion!"  Gargan slammed
a fist into Bob's belly, knocking the wind out of him, sending him flying
across the room.  Bob smashed into a wall and slid to the floor with a
groan. 
 </p><p align=left>
"And this is for giving me bad gas!"  The shadow hulk jumped into the air
and landed on top of Bob, all 500 pounds of him.  Bob broke more than
few ribs and his body flattened into a pancake. 
 </p><p align=left>
"And this..." Gargan wrapped his arms around Bob in a bearhug. "This is my
apology for killing you. I'm sorry. I thought you were boring but you
turned out to be such an interesting guy!"  Gargan wept black tears as Bob
squirmed in his massive grasp. 
 </p><p align=left>
"Purple, you're a shaman.  Heal the man!" said Gargan. "And then Bob and I 
will have a drink!"
 </p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, a dozen pouches remain scattered on the floor.  But now that
the dancing and music had stopped since Gargan's appearance, the tavern
was quieter, and the ticking sound was obvious.  Not it mattered to most
people.  They thought an ordinary clock was lying around somewhere...
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Sir Twist]**
</p><p align=left>
We now take a break to behind the back door of the bar for a brief,
non-musical and semi-serious interlude.
</p><p align=left>
Measure Three Narthe opened his bleary eyes to a spinning world. He heard
voices nearby, which seemed to be concerning him, but he couldn't be sure.
</p><p align=left>
"Do with we what now him?" One voice demanded.
</p><p align=left>
"He's kill, a him Head-hard," a second said. "Law about and they're order all."
</p><p align=left>
Narthe shook his head to try to clear it. Obviously, the two were Xaositec
scum. He felt a dull throb at the back of his neck, and tried to move a
hand to it, only to find that he'd been tied to a chair. He looked about
him. Over in the corner were his sword and armour.
</p><p align=left>
"Him kill?" asked the first voice incredulously. "Let's drunk him get! Show
chaos a good time in him -- "
</p><p align=left>
" -- and let him hangover about it in his worry!" finished the second exitedly.
</p><p align=left>
At that moment a shout of "Hay Macarena!" caused Narthe to jump from his
seat...only that his seat was attached to him and he fell to the ground.
</p><p align=left>
But the Xaositecs hardly noticed. "Macarena?" they said in unison. Quickly
the pulled him upright and cut the bonds from his chair. They dragged him
to his feet and through a doorway that lead into a kitchen...through
another doorway into a room full of people.
</p><p align=left>
Except that this was no normal room. Judging from the glasses and bottles
on a nearby line of crates, and a ship's crowsnest and riggin in the middle
of the large room, this was Quake's Tavern. Well, he'd entered it.
</p><p align=left>
The people consisted of a kobold, several humans (one in bunny slippers),
four mephits, a MODRON?, a dwarf, a large female (probably of giant stock,
he noted), and Quake -- except that quake wasn't a half-elf tonight: she
was a githzerai. Well, with her reputed ability to wield magic, anything
was possible -- and what was that half-naked monstrosity that was sitting
at the bar with one of the humans? It couldn't possibly be -- but it had to
be! It was the Gargan.
</p><p align=left>
His captors drew him to the line of crates and Quake served them up some
ale, but they pushed the tankards aside, telling her, "Give us and the
Hardhead sod here something a little more chaotic."
</p><p align=left>
Quake raised an eyebrow, even as she began to shift from side to side in
some sort of dance. "You got any jink?"
</p><p align=left>
One of the two reached for Narthe's belt pouch and threw it on the counter.
"For the whole evening." Quake eyed the contents and nodded, turning to
pour them another drink. "Drink," the Xaositec said, "it'll make you feel
better." The other pinched his nose and they forced him to swallow the
contents of the glass.
</p><p align=left>
It felt decidedly different from the water rations Narthe lived on. It
felt...warm and fuzzy, even as it went down. "Give me some more," he
demanded.
</p><p align=left>
The woman at the bar nodded, and poured him another one, which he downed
without thinking. Good stuff, this was.
</p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, the Gargan had begun to eye Narthe's companions. The giant hulk
pulled himself to his feet and suddenly swung his great axe, cutting of the
heads of two Xaositecs sitting at the bar.
</p><p align=left>
The first had barely the time to yell "There's a bomb in the house!" before
his voice was cut off at the head.
</p><p align=left>
The second, had meanwhile noticed Mathais beginning to cast a spell. The
last thing he ever managed to do was to yell "BABBLE" at the mage. All of a
sudden, the walls and floor were covered in deep blue roses, and the
rigging around the crows nest turned to thorned vines.
</p><p align=left>
Gargan turned back to Bob. "You see?" he said. "The silly ones are the
worst, and so I have to get rid of 'em."
</p><p align=left>
Narthe turned back to Quake. "Get me another one."
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Kris Mckinnon]**
</p><p align=left>
The Xaositect's head, still wearing a look of surprise, was shot backwards
by the force of Gargans blow, pinwheeling across the bar like some kind of
demented, animate pinyata. It landed with a sodden thump in the middle of
Eduardo's table. He stared at it in disgust, then shrugged and pulled out
an easel from his rucksack. Squinting thoughfully, he held out a thumb to
judge the size of the Xaosmans impressive probisicis. He smiled happily,
finally finding a model that wouldn't move every five seconds. Maybe he
shood look into taxidermy as a hobby.
</p><p align=left>
Davidia pulled her hands back the table and wrinkled her nose. "Ewww, its
landed on my drink." She said. Turning to Eggy with a pouting look she
said. "Would you mind moving that sweety?"
</p><p align=left>
Eggy grunted and grabbed the head by its long ponytail. Seeing the look of
annoyance on Eduardos face, he reconsidered his first impulse, which was to
try and see how many heads he could bounce it off of, and instead put it
down carefully on the floor. As an added bonus, he picked up the
prophylatic that had fallen out of Eduardos pouch and placed it on top of
the head, returning to his seat with a chuckle. "Hur hur hur." 
</p><p align=left>
Eduardo gave him a look of long suffering paitience, then pushed his chair
back to get a better look at the newly altered portrait. as he did so, he
idly asked. "What did he say anyway?" 
</p><p align=left>
Davidia ventured. "I think he said something about this bar being full of
bums."
</p><p align=left>
This prompted Eggy to pinch hers,  of course, which made her jump and glare
back angrily at him . His face, or what you could see of it under the
beard, promptly turned red and he mumbled. "Hur hur hur ..sorry." 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh you!" Davidia said with obvious love (or some baser emotion) and
slapped him on the shoulder affectionately, which sent Eggy hurtling
towards the floor. Looking back up at her from his prone position, he
suddenly burst into laughter. A moment later she joined in, both of them
laughing in shared hilarity. Eduardo just shook his head and continued to
sketch. he was used to their antics by now. His eyes wandered over to a
brightly colored object lying on the floor beside the head. His hand
suddenly stopped its casual movements and slowly put the parchment down on
the table. 
</p><p align=left>
"Uhh guys?" He began, but Davidia and Eggy were in the middle of one of
their whispered gigglesations and weren't paying attention to him. "Guys?"
He asked again, and recived no response. Picking up his takard, he threw it
with all his might at Davidias head. With an audible bong, it careened off
her cranium and narrowly missed Quakes head as it flew past the bar. 
</p><p align=left>
Davidia stopped giggling for a second and turned towards Eduardo, who's
eyes were still locked on the object below. "Yes Eddie?" 
</p><p align=left>
"You're sure that Xaosmen said this bar was full of bums? Not any other
word that might bare a close ressemblance to bums but have a completetly
different meaning?" Eduardo asked again, carefully picking up the large
clock and bundle of bright red sticks. "Say, like 'bomb'?" He said, getting
out of his chair and holding the bomb out before him.
</p><p align=left>
Davidia's eyes widened as she took in the loud, menancing ticking sound
that the clock gave off. "Well, I could have been wrong." She admitted in a
small voice. 
</p><p align=left>
Eduardo smiled at the patrons that stared at him with a kind of terrified
fascination. "Don't worry folks!" He announced in a clear confident voice.
"I've had several courses in bombs in my time. Don't worry about a thing.
Besides" he added thoughtfully. "If this does go off I'm sure that none of
you willl feel it when your limbs and skin are blown off by the blast."
Oblivious to the panic he was causing, he continued. "And of course, you
might get lucky and be killed instantly by flying debris. I'm sure that
almost none of you will be forced to wait in agony as your intestines drip
out of your bodies...." continuing his rambling, he carefully placed the
bomb on  his table and opened his rucksack and placed it beside him.
Davidia appeared quietly beside him and from somewhere a bright light shown
down at him, highlighting the sweat dripping tensely down his brow. 
</p><p align=left>
"Scapel." He asked tersly. Davidia slapped it into his palm, giving him a
nasty cut on his thumb. He turned to her and gave her a look. She smiled
prettily and shrugged. Eduardo turned back to the bomb, occasionally asking
for more tools. The patrons looked on anxiously, although a few of them had
the presence of mind to jump out the nearest available exit. Long minutes
passed for the rest of them as Eduardo labored tensly over the menacing
package. 
</p><p align=left>
Finally he wiped the sweat from his brow and stepped back. A small cloth
now covered the bomb, attached to a rope that Eduardo held in one of his
hands. With a flourish, he pulled the rope and the cloth fell away
revealing the bomb. The clock was still ticking  and even closer to the
little red mark, but now it was painted the pale green that seemed to be a
close match for the vomit stains on the floor. Little pinkish spines shot
out at crazy angles from the deadly package as it slowly counted down to
zero. 
</p><p align=left>
Eduardo stood beside it obviously waiing for comments.  He grew annoyed as
the dead silence that filled the bar went on 
</p><p align=left>
 "Well? What do you think?"
</p><p align=left>
At the last moment before the bomb exploded someone cleared their throat
and said. "Well...the spines are a bit much." 
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
**[Brannon Hollingsworth]**
</p><p align=left>
The music finally ending, the hieroglyphic-appearing thri-kreen let 
her arms fall, falling tiredly, limply to her sides.  She scanned the 
room quickly, looking for the danger that she knew was not only near 
but insatiable:  The Slayer of Secluded Souls, the Destroyer of 
Undiscovered Characters, Gargan...
</p><p align=left>
Her insectile head pivoting and swiveling quickly, almost 
mechanically, to and fro, she scanned the rest of the confusing 
carnage about the room and mentally wacked herself for coming into 
this addle-coved bar in the first place.  She made a mental note never 
to do so again...
</p><p align=left>
Ducking under the cover of a rather copious, newly formed bush of deep 
blue roses, she hastily plotted her next move.  Snatching the 'recipe' 
she had been carrying from her uppermost, usually belligerent left 
hand with her lowermost right, she began reading the back side of the 
paper.
</p><p align=left>
At the top of the paper, written in a thin, spidery hand, words 
obviously borne of magic swirled.  'Spell Song #6, by 
C'chack-kitch-rittka, Bard of the Burning Sands.', it read, and 
C'chack's mandibles moved side to side quickly as she began the chant 
that would unleash it's horrid power.  Her arms swirling and dipping 
in a hypnotic pattern, she slowly began to rise from the blue, thorned 
brush, her insect-like, buzzing, droning voice rising with her.
</p><p align=left>
'When I was young,
and didn't have no sense.
</p><p align=left>
'stuck my abdomen to
an ensorcelled fence.
</p><p align=left>
It shocked my tr'issk,
burnt my claws,
</p><p align=left>
And blew a hole,
outta my cover-alls!'
</p><p align=left>
With the final, ear-splitting syllable, C'chack, the spell-slinging 
Bard of the Burning Sands, let loose her fury upon the one that she 
knew had come for her head as well...

**[James Crane]**
</p><p align=left>
	Gargan sat, oblivious to his surroundings. Ale after ale, he drank.  He 
had been defeated by a mere mortal named "Bob". Oh how he longed for 
revenge. He would cleave Bob's head off his shoulders in a moment, had 
it not been for the pie fight. Bob was no longer insignificant. He had 
failed. The mug touched his lips once more as he pondered the situation. 
The building fell quit when his mug pounded onto the bar. He slowly 
stood, all eyes looking at him in fear. "My job is not done yet." He 
thundered: "The gem. The ork. They are going nowhere! They are 
insignificant. Justice shall be served! The ork is dead." Gargan hoisted 
his huge axe above his head. Screaming like a barmy, he ran across the 
room to where the modron stood. Swinging his axe down in an arc, he 
cleaved the modron in two. "I shall kill the ork, and then return to 
cleanse this story of all the non-essentials. Justice shall be done." The 
sensate in the crows nest looked worried. The tiefiling with whom he had 
the earlier encounter trembled in fear. Gargan was back. Gargan ran out 
of the room, screaming through the streets of Sigil.
</p><p align=left>
Eduardo turned back to the bomb after the departure of Gargan. He had no 
reason to be afraid. He had made himself significant. "I am someone! I 
am essential! I'm smart enough; I'm good enough; and, gosh darn it, 
people like me!" he shouted. Eggy looked at his friend with surprise. 
"Eduardo..." Eduardo was snapped back into awareness. "Yes Eggy???" "THE 
BOMB!" shouted Eggy back. "Oh, yeah, the bomb. Heh,heh."
Eduardo quickly turned back to the clock. A loud ringing emanated from 
the bell. People dove in all directions. Tables were overturned. Curses 
were yelled. Prayers were said. "Well, it's tea time" said the sensate 
located up in the crow's nest. The sensate jumped from his location 
above the tavern, landing on the floor with a loud "Thump!". Slowly 
staggering to his feet, he pulled out a tiny tea cup, and tea pot. A 
thick dark liquid flowed from the pot, looking more like dirty water 
than tea. Having filled the cup, he removed from another pocket a large 
earthen container. He reached for a spoon as he opened the lid with his 
free hand. He scooped two spoonfuls of sugar from it, emptying them into 
the cup. From yet another pocket, he pulled a crumpet. He took a look at 
the crumpet, which had grown green mold, and had many black spots, and 
took a bite. 
</p><p align=left>
**********************************************************************
</p><p align=left>
Gargan ran down the streets, yelling obscenities. "Buy my Beans!" shouted a 
grosser. "Unessential, meaningless, fool!" Thundered Gargan. A swift 
swing of the axe lopped of the grocer's head. He laughed as it rolled 
on the pavement. A rat scuttled across the road. "Ugly, no-use, rat!" he 
shouted. With out breaking stride, he squashed the rat underneath the 
heel of his boot. "Nonproductive peasant!" he said as he cleaved the 
head of another passerby. "But I was anonymous" Were the last words from 
the peasant's throat. Gargan stopped. "Oops, sorry 'bout that. Heh,heh". 
Gargan once more set off through the streets of Sigil, looking for Pug 
the ork.
</p><p align=left>
**********************************************************************
</p><p align=left>
Tea time being over, the tavern returned to its normal state, if you 
could say it had one. A loud bang disrupted the quietness of the tavern. 
Everyone turned toward the door, which had just been thrown open. 
Outside stood a single clueless kender. Quake whispered to KK. "Check 
the silverware when he leaves."
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Shelaam]**
</p><p align=left>
The tiefling (who's name I had learned to be Eduardo) stood expectantly in
the centre of the room for a few moments before all of my patrons broke
into a standing ovation. A shame Gargan had only just stalked out of the
place - those spines would appeal to any Mercykiller. But I knew he'd be
back.
</p><p align=left>
I couldn't stand around admiring art all night, though. _Someone_ had to
get the fun started. Amid the crescendo of applause (if the uncontrolled
babble of clacking sounds coming from the thri-keen qualified), I slipped
behind a batch of crates and moved towards the side door. This party was
about to go off with a bang.
</p><p align=left>
The applause died down, apart from the thri-kreen, who seemed especially
enthused from under a table, and by the time the cactus of a bomb in the
centre of the room began its final countdown with a loud "Ahem <cough>
tick, tick, Tick, TICK" things were ready to roll.
</p><p align=left>
-------------------
</p><p align=left>
<TICK> <KABlllluuurrrrrrrrrgghhhhhhhh>
</p><p align=left>
Thousands of small multicoloured objects, apparently butterflies, spewed
from the pink and green object in the centre of the taproom. The 'applause'
of the thri-kreen finally ended as well (coincidentally at exactly the same
moment) and a spray of dust sparyed into the air, descending in a thick
shower. The dust burst into bright motes of light, a curtain enveloping the
far side of the tavern, coating the butterflies that were steadily pouring
in. And through that curtain of light ...
</p><p align=left>
Strode Quake. Somehow changed into a long red coat and top hat, she flung
her arms wide and exclaimed to the captive crowd,
</p><p align=left>
"Goooooooodddddd evening ladies, gentlemen and others. Without further ado,
I present for your entertainment tonight the most stupendous act in Sigil,
direct from the Layer of Torment, the iron city of Dis, I give you:"
</p><p align=left>
"FIENDPOWER"
</p><p align=left>
From behind the curtain of light motes a measured beat sprang up, and as
they quickly cleared five silhouettes became visible, gyrating to the beat
on what appeared to be a hastily constructed stage of crates and planks. As
the lights dissipated it became apparent that the two figures on both sides
were tall, lean hunks of muscle and beard, sporting nothing but a razor
sharp glaive and spike studded g-string each.
</p><p align=left>
They each whirled around the shaft of their polearm, perfectly synchronized
with the beat and trumpets of the spinagons playing behind them. The twelve
foot tall figure in the centre, blood red skin stretched tightly over
bulging biceps and a six-pack to build a bridge on, spun to face the crowd,
morkrophone in claw. "Lets groove, victims!"
</p><p align=left>
Davidia, Mathias and Narthe sprung forward in unison, looks of rapture on
their faces, racing to be the first to the front of the stage.
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

</p><p align=left>
**[Matt M Oostman]**
</p><p align=left>
	Upon reaching the stage, Davidia, Mathias and Narthe joined the
fiends in their presintation. Constantly dodgeing the spinning polearms,
Davidia had a notion. "HEY!" he proclaimed, "they're trying to kill us
off!" "Oh?" pondered Mathais, dodging another blade, "I suppose they
are."  "Well do something about it!" shouted Narthe.  "OK, I'll try,"
stated Mathais and began chanting a whispy poem. Suddenly the trio and
dancers shot up, the roof and stage were growing! "Now quick! Get us
down!" demanded Narthe. "NO! Blast them!" countered Davidia. "Cast
Featherfall!" "No, Fireball!" "Featherfall!" "Fireball!" "Enough! I'm
casting, I say we comprimise! I'll do a little of each!" stated Mathais
decisavly. "So what'cha gonna cast?" asked Davidia. "FeatherBall!"
shouted Mathais. Suddenly the air erupted with feathers as the trio and
the fiends were thrown off the the platform. "Ahhhhhhh!" they screamed,
all except Mathais who shouted "COWABUNGA!". Davidia and Narthe landed in
a heap of feathers, the fiends in the new rosebush, and Mathais in a keg
of ale. Happy in his new predicament, Mathais pretended be unconsious.
Dreamweaver the Psuedodragon flew out of the bar in search of Mathais'
brother, Kerjal, to tell him that Mathais was drunk and hadden't yet
begun to cast any spells.
</p><p align=left>
	Eggy ordered another drink, there was a butterfly in this one and
it was far to colorful to have supposed to have been there. Quark went to
get him a refill and found Mathais in the keg and promply removed him
with the help of Baker Bob and his pizza spatula. Noticing that the
fiends were up he left the keg without a fight and went to sit with
Davidia and Narthe. The dancers must have seen this because they headed
right for them. Narthe, fearing they'd have to dance again or worse,
insisted that they change the fiends into rats. "Alright, now what was
the name of that spell?" "Polymorph Other" Davidia said helpfully.
"Right," Mathais said and started to spew the words of magic. Suddenly,
without warning, the little old lady behind them began to shrink and
become more and more mouse like. "Mom?" the man across from her shreiked
in horror. "What the?!?" commented Narshe, stunned. "It was your idea,"
stated Mathais, "Polymoroph Mother". "Oh boy" Davidia gasped. The fiends
were approaching.
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
**[Mr. Niceguy]**
</p><p align=left>
'That's enough of that!' roared the pit fiend frontman for Fiendpower.
Suddenly, the bar was dead silent.  No one moved; no one *could* move.
Fiendish charisma boiled the air, stifling everyone in their tracks.
</p><p align=left>
  Narthe, Mathias and Davidia were caught in mid-air, jumping off their
table in an attempt to crowd surf over to the bar.  The freezing effect
was fortunate for them, because the only crowd that was there to catch
them were the troop of cranium rats scuttling back into their holes. 
The incipient squashing was incipiently squashed.
</p><p align=left>
  Eggy was not so lucky.  He looked as if he were about to drown from
the torrent of ale pouring out of the upended tankard he held over his
gaping mouth.  He meant only to take a big lusty dwarfish swig, but now
it looked as if he were going to get his high-school wish and die from an
excess of booze.  Oh, if only he hadn't brought along the Infinitely
Refilling Tankard today!
</p><p align=left>
  'Hur, hur, hurrrr,' rumbled the pit fiend.  'Nothing I like better
than a captive audience!'  Its tail lashed out and wrapped around
Mathias and Davidia, plucking the two out of the humid air like flaccid
butterflys and mounting them inside a cage filled with spikes.  'You two
look like you'll be able to hit the high notes, and this *is*
Sing-a-Long night.'  It started the weighted, bladed pendulum at the top
of the cage swinging and howled, 'Let's do it, boyzzz!'
</p><p align=left>
  With that, the fiend leapt back, so that the two gigantic skeletal
bandmembers at the back of the stage could wheel their instruments
forward.  The mere sight of the ba'atorian banjo caused the entire bar
to gasp even through its paralyzed state.  The dreaded accordion of the
abyss in the claws of the other osyluth nearly caused them all to drop
over in a faint.
</p><p align=left>
  The horror was complete as the terrible lead fiend came forward again,
to sit delicately on the edge of the stage and start plucking at his
ukelele.  One of the glaive-strung barbazu dragged Lawrence Welk
forward, and after a pitiful 'A-Wunna, und A-Too-a' escaped his lips,
the mighty fiend in front started screeching out his hell-spawned song:
</p><p align=left>
  'Ohhhhh... <br>
   Tip-toe, <br>
   through the tulips,<br>
   through the tulips,<br>
   through the tulips,<br>
   Oh won't you come a-long,<br>
   and<br>
   Tip-toe,<br>
   Though the tulips, with meeee!'
</p><p align=left>
  The bar collectively wished at once that the ticking pouch *had* been
holding a bomb...
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
**[John Gonzalez]**
</p><p align=left>
Pug the orc ambled down Mumbleberry street a few kips from the flat 
he shared with his old mother, blissfully unaware of the doom that 
possibly awaited him in the form of the literary device known as Gargan.
</p><p align=left>
'Oi, its kinda late,' Pug thought to hisself, ' hope the ole bat isn't waiting up for me.'
</p><p align=left>
As the large orc reached the door of the kip he quietly removed his 
hobnailed boots, the ones with the Prof. Tusker's logo, and looked in 
through a hole in the door. Everything was quiet in the unlit 
living room/kitchenette.
</p><p align=left>
'Looks good, must be asleep' Pug ruminated as he slowly opened the 
door, 'heh, good thing for my infravision'
</p><p align=left>
Barely two feet into the small apartment, someone snapped their 
fingers, instantly lighting every candle and lantern in the place.
"Gah! my eyes..." yelled Pug as he tried to cover his eyes, dropped 
the boots on his toe, jumped up and smashed his head on the ceiling, 
stumbled about, put his hand on the hot stovetop and finally tripped 
over the footstool with a mighty crash with his head at the old 
woman's feet.
</p><p align=left>
"Pugnacious Quib, what would your father have to say about the way 
you're wasting your life." shrilled the old woman to the horizontal 
orc, "Look at me when I am scolding you boy." A meaty thwap of her 
cane on the top of his lumpy head punctuated the last command.
</p><p align=left>
"owwww..." moaned Pug, " Muther, I was just helping out at the soup kitchen."
</p><p align=left>
Twhap.."oiwww"
</p><p align=left>
"That's exactly waht I'm talking about you sniveling toad, Grabnafug 
would be out sacking a village or raising an army of like-minded orcs 
ready to pillage and burn.  Helping gutterswine who don't have the 
gumption to get out of the filth, what a waste." stated the old 
witch. Pug rolled over unto his back and sat up, "Well why don't you 
just mosey on down to Acheron and ask him what he thinks."
The old woman nearly dropped her cane and gasped, "Why you ungrateful 
bootlicker, I'm going to each you some manners." With that she 
straightened up and began casting.
</p><p align=left>
Pug knowing he was in trouble but not really caring, reached into his 
pocket to put his money pouch on the table, his hand came up with the 
gem he had found earlier, as he said, "Oh shut up you old hag."
There was a flash of red light, and all was quiet. Pug slowly turned 
around and saw to his surprise his step mother, squirming in her 
chair tightly bound by some clear material which came up to just 
under her nose. If looks could kill he would be a dead orc,
"Ummm muther, I just remembered I gotta go...um meeting or..something."
</p><p align=left>
Pug ran out the door , just remembering to grab his Prof Tusker's as 
he jetted out into the Sigilian night.
</p><p align=left>
elsewhere...
</p><p align=left>
Licksey the Pixie slowly got up and stumbled as he got his bearings. 
The gem was gone, 'oh well easy come easy go' thought the pixie, 
'like this bump on my head I hope.'
</p><p align=left>
There was a most decidedly ungodlike din coming from Quake's as 
Licksey fluttered towards the door, keeping an eye out for suspicious 
looking archways.
</p><p align=left>
As the diminutive fellow snuck in he saw a most unusually sight, most 
the patrons were not moving and they weren't even unconscious.
'What gives?' Licksey though when he suddenly spotted Fiendpower, 'Oh boy.'
</p><p align=left>
Flitting around staying out of site, Licksey wondered what he could 
do, as he past a drowning dwarf, he slightly nudged the upturned mug 
over so that it poured over the dwarf's head and not his mouth. The 
bearded warrior, didn't look particularly grateful.
</p><p align=left>
The pixie started to rummage through his pouches mumbling, " I knew I 
had a Mordekaine's Instant Disgruntled Critic here somewhere...."
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
**[Avi]**
</p><p align=left>
A dark hulking figure stormed through the streets, naked except for a
helmet and a pair of boxer shorts.  Gargan turned into an alleyway and
spotted his prey, Pug the orc, who was sitting down and staring into a
shiny red gem.  Gargan roared, "Aha! I found you!"  Gargan was about to
say "I'm not going to kill you anymore because you turned out to be more
interesting lately."  However, Pug used the gem before Gargan could utter
those words.  The gem flashed and bound the executioner in some sort of
invisible webbing. 
</p><p align=left>
Bellowing with anger, Gargan flexed his massive muscles and did what few
other beings could do -- he snapped them apart.  The orc shrieked,
pocketed the gem, and fled. 
</p><p align=left>
Pug ran out into the middle of a street, where he promptly slipped on a
banana peel and fell on his head.  Groaning, he stood up just in time to
see a carriage smash into him.  The orc crawled to one side of the street
and lay there.  A Dustman picked him up, thinking he was dead, and dumped
him into a cart full of corpses before Pug could protest.  As the cart
began to move, the poor orc pushed aside the stinking carcasses and jumped
out.  He landed badly and twisted an ankle.  After being run over by
another carriage, he stumbled into a tavern where people jeered and hurled
empty mugs at him.  He fled into the washroom where he found a penny on
the floor.  Grinning at this turn of luck, he left the washroom.  However,
the washroom door was a portal and the penny was a gatekey.  Pug stepped
into the Elemental Plane of Fire and burned himself badly before he could
step back into Sigil.  As he left the tavern, he was bombarded by more
mugs and food leftovers.  He continued down the street and had many
interesting encounters with Car Horns of Blasting, tubs of man-eating
hamsters, and Samurai Slaadi Street Punks.  Then he turned around the
corner and met the Lady of Pain. 
 </p><p align=left>
Gargan went back to the tavern to enjoy a mug of ale.  He arrived at
Quake's and saw KK the stone golem, vigilantly on watch, oblivious to the
events inside.  When Gargan strode into the tavern, the patrons lit up
with hope.  The fiends froze, their hearts skipping a beat.  The massive
shadowy hulk looked at the baatezu and said, "Hmm.. ya, I guess you guys
are interesting to the story.  I won't execute you."  The fiends sighed in
relief, the patrons fell back into despair, and the fiends continued with
their fun.
 </p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, Pug's body lay on the ground, bruised and burnt and carved up
by a million bloody gashes.  The orc's head lay some distance from the
body, severed by the Lady's gaze.  And lo and behold, the eyes opened. 
Pug was alive, or his head was anyway.  He cursed the terrible luck he got
ever since he picked up that gem, that Gem of Cursed Luck with a secondary
power of Force Web. 
</p><p align=left>
A kender came by. "Oh look at shiny red gem!  Someone must have dropped
it.  I'll hold onto it for safekeeping.  Oh and look!  A talking head!
I'll just take that and drop it into my bag."  The kender continued
towards Quake's tavern.
</p><p align=left>

**[Daniel Reddy]**
</p><p align=left>
G'rrrl Bargle sat back and looked contentedly at her drink.  The Fiend 
reflected on what luck she had been having thus far...she had 
successfully bobbed some fool Modron into letting her 'appraise' it's 
gem - which was, of course, enough time to switch it with a worthless 
duplicate.  The gem now sat in a padlocked pouch attached to her right 
hip.  Gargan's entrance created a wave to her   contented musings, but 
that was soon over.  Now, everything was going just fine.  She ordered 
another Mind Blaster.
</p><p align=left>******</p><p align=left>
Alliwishus the Kender walked into Quake's.  The moment he saw it, he 
knew he must have it: a beautiful lock attached to a pouch.  The lock 
had an ornate demon face carved on it.  He made a beeline to the lock, 
as if it had called him.
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
There was a noise at the door.  G'rrl turned and looked, and then began 
snickering.  A Deva had entered, and then realised this was not his kind 
of place.  He was now frantically trying to exit - right over a group of 
Tieflings.  This ought to be fun.  As she turned back to her drink, she 
noticed a topknot sitting next to her.  A topknot?  She leaned over and 
looked closer. A Kender turned, looked at her, and then smiled broadly.  
A Kender? A Kender?!  A Kender!!!
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
Gargan was interrupted by a sound as he was attempting to drown in his 
next ale.  It was a low moan that started increasing in pitch.  He 
turned.  The Fiend closest to him was staring at a Kender that was in 
between them.  A Kender...sitting next to him.  This is not good. Gargan 
moved two stools away from the Kender. The moan was now becoming a 
screech.
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
Alliwishus couldn't understand what was wrong with the Fiend.  After 
all, he was just being nice by smiling at the Fiend.  The Fiend should 
by happy - most people twist their faces and make retching noises while 
running away.  But no, this Fiend had to start salavating from it's 
massive maw, dripping onto him.  And then there was that strange noise 
it was making.  And now it had grabbed his hair and was lifting him up 
until he was level with it's face.
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
G'rrl held the Kender in one hand while frantically looking for her 
pouch with the other.  The pouch was there.  The padlock was not.  The 
Gem in the pouch? Gone too.  "Where is it?!"" she bellowed.  The Kender 
squirmed and said "What?"  Deceitful creatures.  G'rrl noticed the 
Kender's multiple pouches.  She began ripping them open furiously.  An 
Orc's head popped out of one and rolled down the bar, stopping in front 
of Gargan.  G'rrl stopped for a moment, wondering if she had just erred 
and would receive an Axe.  Just then Her Gem fell to the floor.  She 
smiled, thinking of wonderful ways to cook a Kender...when another 
identical gem hit the floor, landing next to it.  G'rrl looked at the 
Kender.  He just smiled. She hurled him and then dove towards the gems.
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
Alliwishus was flying.  He had a soft landing, almost as if landing on a 
pillow.  He turned and looked up at an angry Deva. The Deva was arguing 
with some Tieflings when his unexpected intrusion occurred.  The 
Tieflings did not notice him, but the Deva glowered at him.  He smiled, 
and said "that thing on the floor there just threw me at you."  The Deva 
snarled and yelled "Damn you, cursed Fiend."
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
The entryway erupted into mass pandemonium, as several Tieflings tackled 
the Deva, all landing on top of G'rrl.  G'rrl watched as the gems were 
knocked into opposing directions.  And the Fight was on!
</p><p align=left>*****</p><p align=left>
Gargan looked down to see Pug staring at him...
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

**[Avi]**
</p><p align=left>
Quake stood behind the bar, frozen under the pit fiend's spell.  This is a
tragedy, she thought.  Tonight the tavern had been boiling with chaos. 
Now it was frozen in the iron grip of a Law-maker.  Not to mention that my
armpit itches and I can't do a damn thing about it! 
 </p><p align=left>
She tried to make sense of the recent events.  Everyone was paralyzed and
the fiends were singing a diabolical song.  Mathias and Davidia were
stuffed into a cage, a bladed pendulum descending towards their motionless
heads.  Licksy the pixie entered the bar, searched his pockets for
Mordenkainen's Instant Disgruntled Critic, but was instantly frozen under
the pitfiend's spell.  Then Gargan came in for a drink of ale, oblivious
to the events around him and unaffected by the fiendish magic. 
 </p><p align=left>
The pitfiend roared, "Time for a meal!  Everyone take a break."  The
hellsong was thankfully over.  The head of Fiendpower pulled on a chef's
hat, smacked his lips and said, "I feel like cooking some people.  Anybody
have a problem with that?"  The frozen patrons could not protest.  "Good! 
Then I'll make some swedish meatballs."  The pitfiend gathered Krax,
Purple and the Sensate and took the paralyzed trio into the kitchen.
 </p><p align=left>
His head reappeared through the kitchen doorway.  "Oh, by the way, it's a
little too quiet.  I need to hear a bit of squealing and cries of pain." 
Suddenly, Mathias and Davidia were free to move again.  Davidia looked up
to see the swinging blade just an inch above her head.  The two began to
scream, music to the pitfiend's ear. 
 </p><p align=left>
"Do something!" squealed Davidia.
 </p><p align=left>
"Okay, okay, um, um, um, um, um, um," Mathias stuttered.
 </p><p align=left>
Davidia grabbed the elven mage and yelled, "Cast a spell, you looney!" 
 </p><p align=left>
Mathias took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off his brow.  "Right.  How
about a Wib, Wob, I mean, a Web spell."  Thick webbing shot out towards
the swinging pendulum.  The blade easily severed the cobwebs and continued
on its course.  "Oh no, oh no. Now what?" 
 </p><p align=left>
Davidia bent down as low as possible, but her huge bulk was guaranteed to
meet the blade before it met Mathias.  "Stop it," she wailed. 
 </p><p align=left>
"Um, um, um.  I know, if I turn you to stone, then the blade can't nick
you and I'll convert you back to flesh later." 
 </p><p align=left>
"What?!" Davidia roared.
</p><p align=left> 
Mathias took that as a yes. "Flesh to bone, tone, I mean.. Flesh to
stone!"  he chanted.  Davidia's flesh immediately petrified.  The blade
banged into her stone head and grinded to a halt.  Mathias sighed in
relief.  He didn't dare look at the angry features etched into her stone
face. 
 </p><p align=left>
Quake, still frozen, sighed to herself.  She hoped that the bumbling mage
could later turn her back to normal.  Now she saw a kender enter the
tavern.  With typical kender bravado, he pickpocketed a gem from a female
cornugon who was lounging around the bar.  Meanwhile, a deva and a group
of tieflings entered the room.  Strangest of all, a talking orc head was
yelling curses at nobody in particular.  Since the pitfiend was in the
kitchen, they were not frozen under his spell, and she hoped that the deva
would so something to save them. 
 </p><p align=left>
But now, the newcomers were fighting over two identical gems.  The
tieflings succeeded in grabbing one gem.  The kender, the cornugon and the
deva were simultaneously arguing over the other ruby.  Suddenly, the Gem
of Cursed Luck flashed brightly.  A new curse had taken effect. 
 </p><p align=left>
Alliwishus was looking at himself.  Standing a few feet ahead of him was a
kender that looked exactly like him.  "Hey, who are you?"  The identical
kender looked equally confused.  The fiend was also staring in shock. 
Alliwishus also noticed that something was different about himself.  For
one thing, he was taller and had golden skin and white wings.

"I'm inside the deva's body!" Alliwishus exclaimed.  "How interesting!" 
He marvelled at his golden skin and spread his feathery white wings.  The
kender-deva took off on a wobbly flight around the room.  To everyone's
annoyance, his large wings buffeted objects and people, knocking them onto
the floor.  After a few minutes, he got bored of this new experience and
reverted to acting like a kender, which meant absentmindedly pickpocketing
the frozen patrons (many of which now lay on the ground). And so a shining
deva wandered through the room, stealing from people like a common thief. 
 </p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, G'rrr screamed to herself.  Trapped in a kender's body!  It's
so small and weak, with soft flesh and no claws or teeth.  But I still
have my mind, so I can still use my innate magic.  She retreated into the
shadows, planning how to make the best of this bad situation. 
</p><p align=left> 
Orion the deva looked around the room through the eyes of a cornugon.  He
reflected on the irony of his shining soul locked inside a scaly fiendish
body.  And worst of all, his own celestial body being abused by a kender
thief.  But there were matters more urgent -- a pit fiend was about to
make human meatballs.  The deva-fiend used a cloth to pick up the Gem of
Cursed Luck and strode into the kitchen.
 </p><p align=left>
A huge meat grinder lay in the kitchen, and Purple and the Sensate were
stuffed inside it.  Krax stood near the handle, his body frozen except for
his arms.  "Turn the handle, you sodding piss-pod!" the pit fiend was
yelling.  "Grind them up or you'll feel my sting!"  The wind-duke wept
with indecision. 
 </p><p align=left>
The pit fiend turned to see a cornugon enter. "Ah, my fellow fiend!  This
berk needs some... encouragement to grind up his friends.  Be creative." 
 </p><p align=left>
Orion played along. "Of course, master.  But first, I have a gift for
you."  He revealed the shiny red gem.  "A magical gemstone." 
 </p><p align=left>
The pitfiend picked it up with a frown.  "What will I do with such a petty
trinket?"  He tossed the Gem of Cursed Luck into the giant meat grinder. 
And so the unlucky gem -- which caused Licksy to crash into an archway,
which killed Pug and resurrected him as a talking head, which switched the
minds of the deva and the kender and the cornugon -- flashed brightly once
again....
</p><p align=left>
Meanwhile, the kender-deva's belt was bulging with bags containing various
items:  a bag of gold from Eggy, Eduardo's Mr. Stiffy's Manliness Enhancer,
dead Tim's mechanical devices, and many other objects.  How careless of people, 
thought Alliwishus, to leave these things lying around all over place and making 
me responsible for keeping them safe!
</p><p align=left>
He stared curiously at a crow's nest up near the rafters (where the
Sensate used to linger).  The crow's nest was mounted on a wooden pole
which rose from a hole in the floor.  Following a suspicion, Alliwishus
found a door to the cellar and descended down the stairs.
 </p><p align=left>
Lo and behold, a huge ship lay in the basement!  Its mast rose high up
thru the ceiling and into the tavern room above.  "A ship in the basement! 
How fascinating!"  The kender-deva climbed up a ladder and unto the deck. 
</p><p align=left> 
A disembodied voice spoke, "Welcome to my skyship!"
 </p><p align=left>
"Who are you?"
 </p><p align=left>
"My name is HAL," said the soft male voice.  "I am the spirit that
controls this ship.  And who are you?" 
 </p><p align=left>
"My name is Alliwishus.  But you can call me Alliwishu for short.  Mind
you, people usually greet me with 'Ah! Kender!' but 'Ah' is much too short
for a nickname, and my last name is not 'kender'."
 </p><p align=left>
"Then I'll call you Captain Wishy.  How does that sound?"
 </p><p align=left>
"Excellent," Wishy grinned. "Can we go somewhere?  Is there a portal big
enough for this ship?  Can we go to another plane?  I always wanted to see
the Abyss, and Acheron, and the Gray Waste, and the Baator, and Ysgard,
and Mechanus -- actually, people tell me never to go to Mechanus cause I'd
drive the modrons barmy, I wonder why?  Or maybe we can fly over the edge
of Sigil.  Ya, that would be interesting, all that nothing, I've never
seen nothing, I ---" 
 </p><p align=left>
"Perhaps, Captain Wishy, we should just launch the ship first."
 </p><p align=left>
"Right, HAL!  Ship, go!  Up, up and away!  Can we stop by the candy store
before we leave Sigil?" 
 </p><p align=left>
The skyship levitated into the air and crashed through the basement
ceiling.

**[Matt M Oostman]**
</p><p align=left>
	A great rumbling was disturbing Mathais contemplation of escape.
As cage he was trapped in was swaying to and fro, an overstuffed spectral
hand appeared and knocked him across the bars. 
</p><p align=left>
	"I cast ~Cage Cracker~, NOT ~Mage Smacker~!!!" he hollered at the
ceiling, which was also swaying. Fortunatly the bars were bent open by
the misson mast of an enourmous ship.
</p><p align=left>
	 "Great Casper's ghost!" he exclaimed, then, remembering that
Casper was a ghost, regained his sences and hopped aboard the ship.
</p><p align=left>
	 "Who's in charge here?", he demanded.
</p><p align=left>
	 "Why, I am," stated a Kenderish Deva. "You can call me Captin
Wishy."
</p><p align=left>
 	"Good. I'm Mathais, this is Davidia, and this is
Dreamweaver" he stated, tugging the pseudodragon's tail, waking him up.
</p><p align=left>
	 "I say, you appear short handed. AR! Methink ye be needin' a
crew." Mathais suggested in his best pirite voice.
</p><p align=left>
	 "Oh, a crew! I hadden't thought of that. How many's in a crew?
Do they have to be sailors? What about Pug? Do you have to have a body?"
The deva seemed too exited to be a deva and Mathais was starting to
figure this out.
</p><p align=left>
	"You're not a Deva, are you?"
</p><p align=left>
	"That depends. I look like a deva but I was a kender though I'm
not now 'cause I don't look like one. If you look like something you're
not, are you the thing that you are or the thing that you were?"
</p><p align=left>
	"I'm not sure," Mathais said, wondering it himself and trying to
shut him up at the same time. "Let's get you that crew."
</p><p align=left>
	"ALL RIGHT!" he shouted down onto the crowd of paralized people.
"Captain Wishy needs new recruits." Seeing that noone was stepping
forward, he started yelling at the pit fiend. "Hey, are you finished with
the rest of these people in here, I mean, can you unfreeze them?"
</p><p align=left>
	"Fine, but I'll need some bread. I'm making a sandwich from these
two," growled the fiend. 
</p><p align=left>
	Mathais thought for a moment and replied: "I can handle that.
Let's see..... I'm gonna need Orion and Eggy, and unfreeze Quake, it's
her bar. Oh! And Baker Bob. He'll handle your bread and then accompany
us." 
</p><p align=left>
	"And Pug!" shouted the Kender-Deva.
</p><p align=left>
	"Right." the mage said.
</p><p align=left>
	With a quick glance behind him the Baatzu unfroze the patrons
requested and sent them on their way.
</p><p align=left>
	"Now back to the meat grinder," the fiend chuckled.

**[Brannon Hollingsworth]**
</p><p align=left>
C'chack stood, her four arms crossed, and one of her multi-hooked claw 
pads tapping the floor impatiently...
</p><p align=left>
She was awaiting the effect of her spell, the one thing that was going 
to save her from the axe-wielding, head-chopping-off-frequently, 
embodiment-of-Death-himself, Gargan.  Much to her chagrin, nothing had 
happened.  The spell-slinging, sand-spitting bard from Athas was 
perturbed.
</p><p align=left>
"Where's the kaboom?!?  There was supposed to be an earth-shattering 
kaboom!!"
</p><p align=left>
Just then, the kaboom happened, but not in the form of C'chack's 
spell, but rather, in the form of a massive hull of a ship rising up 
from the floor of Quake's tavern.  As she was toppled over by the 
surging of the floorboards, C'chack caught the briefest glimpse of the 
radiant, shining form of a Deva at the helm.
</p><p align=left>
...it seemed to be pulling its hair back into a topknot...
</p><p align=left>
Scrambling to her feet, C'chack scuttled up one of the now fragmented 
floor boards and with a leap that would make a bonespear jealous, 
managed to catch one of the flailing rigging ropes from the side of 
the ship.  Screaming that this was not the right, or even 'her' 
kaboom, she sailed past the bar on her way up, climbing the rope like 
a three-legged bariaur in a foot race.
</p><p align=left>
Quake, ducking the spinning, swirling, many-appendaged obstacle, 
continued drying glasses, sitting them calmly on a shelf that was no 
longer there.  As large sections of her bar's ceiling gave way, 
tumbling to the floor in shattered heaps, she merely shook her head 
slightly, calling after the 'kreen.  "Soddin' prime!  Spell Keys!!  Ya 
gotta have spell keys!!"
</p><p align=left>
Then, the strange ship, with its newly acquired ornament in tow, rose 
slowly above Quake's Tavern, and began heading towards the center of 
the city...
</p><p align=left>
The one place in the whole multiverse that only a kender would want to 
go...

**[Sir Twist]**
</p><p align=left>
Measure Three Narthe openned his eyes. He was on his back again, by the
Lady! How many times was he to be knocked unconscious when he wasn't
watching tonight? His eyes focused a little...on a vaguely humanoid form --
except this one had scales, a tail and horns.
</p><p align=left>
Oh, no. Why me? he asked himself as he forced his eyes to blur once more.
But they wouldn't. They continued to focus until the whole picture was
sharp. There was more than one fiend standing above him. And then he
noticed the ship. What, by the Spire, was a floating ship doing here?
</p><p align=left>
Come to think of it, where was "here"? Oh, yes, he was in some bar...a
Xaositec's bar...the name escaped him. Quail? Quale? Quack? Quake? Yes,
that was it: Quake! Now what was familiar about that name? That's right! He
was here to arrest her! Her and all those Xaositec scum that happened to be
patrons here!
</p><p align=left>
And suddenly it everything came flooding back into him, it was as if
somebody had removed a veil of alcohol from his mind. Coming to the Hive,
the bubber in the street, a sharp pain in his head. The Gargan killing his
captors. The Gargan! he could sure use that Mercykiller's help right now,
he thought to himself as he glanced at the fiends.
</p><p align=left>
He struggled. And then realised he couldn't move anything. Those fiends and
their damned concert! Every muscle save his heart was paralysed! He tried
to shout. "HELP!" Well, that worked.
</p><p align=left>
Quake glanced in the direction of that sound. Who would be calling for
help? Oh, it was that Hardhead. It looked like the fiends were going to be
making a manburger out of him. She should probably the berk get what he
deserved...but then again she could probably get a lot of fun if she saved
him. He _had_ had a lot of that Ysgardian Mead.
</p><p align=left>
She inspected the glass she was polishing. What would be suitable to
convince those fiends that she was serious (for a Xaoswoman)? Conjure
vegetables? Sure, why not...
</p><p align=left>
Taking the rag she was using in her right hand, and setting the glass down
with her left, she threw the cloth at the fiends. A stream of old tomatoes
and cabbages pelted the fiends. They turned around.
</p><p align=left>
"What's the idea, mortal? He's ours!" the leader said.
</p><p align=left>
"No he's not, he's mine! I've got rights over him!" Quake retorted.
</p><p align=left>
"What rights?"
</p><p align=left>
"He's mine" she insisted. "I'll trade this place for him."
</p><p align=left>
The fiends consulted amongst themselves, and nodded to her. One picked up
Narthe and negligently tossed his stiffened form at her. She ducked and
grimaced as the Hardhead hit a table. "Now get out," they said.
</p><p align=left>
Quake helped Narthe to his feet. "Thanks," he said. "You're not as bad as
you seem. I think we might be able to arrange for a lighter sentence for
aiding an Officer of the Law."
</p><p align=left>
The half-elf looked taken aback. "Is that the way you talk to your
fiance?" she lied glibly. "'Arrange for a lighter sentence'? I thought you
would at least kiss me!" Then she glued her lips to his.
</p><p align=left>
Narthe pushed her back. "What's this?" he said. "I came here to arrest you!"
</p><p align=left>
"Really?" she asked. "Do you usually arrest the women you want to marry?
Sounds like a strange thing to do, even for a Harmonium officer."
</p><p align=left>
"Marry? Who said we're getting married?"
</p><p align=left>
"You did, silly. When I poured you your first drink tonight, you asked me
to marry you, and I said yes!" she proclaimed. "Hey, Captain!" she yelled
at the ship. "Throw us a line! We're getting married tonight!"
</p><p align=left>
"Tonight?" echoed Narthe.
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, tonight, dear," she said. "Just like you promised me --" she knew
that'd sink him "-- you know you shouldn't drink so much. That's the first
thing that's going to change when we're married!"
</p><p align=left>
I promised WHAT? Narthe silently queried. Oh well, a promise was a promise.
Whether he had been drunk or not was irrelevant. And now he was stuck with
a Xaositec for a fiance.
</p><p align=left>
Then a rope thrown from above broke his reverie, and he was following his
bride-to-be up the rope. He had to admit, though, as he looked up, that he
_did_ have good taste in women when it came to appearances.
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
   Gargan said, "I'm not going to let the story leave me behind."  The
hulk jumped into the air and landed on deck with a thud.  The thri-keen
quailed with fright.  "Relax,"  Gargan grinned. "You're safe from my
axe... as long you remain interesting." 
 </p><p align=left>
   Now that everyone was aboard the skyship, they wondered "Where to now?" 
And they also wondered, "What's with that Captain Wishy guy?"  That deva
with the topknot was grinning like a 5-year old child, and his pouches
were bulging with items.  At the same time, many of their belongings had
mysteriously vanished. 
</p><p align=left>
   "Welcome to my skyship.  I'm Captain Wishy," he said with obvious glee. 
"And I'm just itching to go somewhere fun!"  The passengers exchanged
incredulous looks.  "First, let's check for attendance."  The kender-deva
pulled out a list of names.  "Baker Bob?  Hey, you're a baker?  Do you
have any buns for me?"
</p><p align=left>
   "Uh, no... I didn't bring my kitchen with me," said Bob.
</p><p align=left>
   Wishy looked crestfallen.  "Oh well."  He pulled out a beautiful ivory
pen to check off Bob's name from the list.
</p><p align=left>
   "Hey!  That's my pen!" yelled Mathias.
</p><p align=left>
   "Really?  You must have dropped it.  Be more responsible next time." 
He pulled out a pencil.
</p><p align=left>
   "Hey! That's my pencil!" yelled Mathias.
</p><p align=left>
   Eight pencils later, Wishy found a pen unclaimed by anyone.  "C.. C... 
Ch.. C'chack?"
</p><p align=left>
   "Here!" the thri-keen called out.
</p><p align=left>
   "Davidia?"  No response. "Davidia?  Davidia?!"
</p><p align=left>
   "She's turned to stone," Eduardo said sourly, and then kicked Mathias.
</p><p align=left>
   And so the kender continued to call out the names of those on deck: 
Eduardo, Eggy, Gargan, Mathias, Narthe, Pug, and Quake.
</p><p align=left>
   Meanwhile, strange things were happening in the kitchen.  Purple and
the Sensate were still stuffed inside the giant meat grinder.  Krax was
about to give in under the pit fiend's torments and turn the handle.
Orion, the deva inside the cornugon's body, prepared to attack the fiend.
Then the Gem of Cursed Luck, which lay inside the meat grinder, flashed
brightly.  Cursed magical energy sank into the metal machine and
transformed it. 
</p><p align=left>
   Suddenly, the meat grinder took on a life of its own...  and worked
backwards!  Instead of making ground meat, it spewed it out whole.  A
fountain of meat -- steaks, hamburgers, hotdogs, ribs, chicken fingers --
spouted out with tremendous force.  Purple and the Sensate were flung up
on a geyser of meat.
</p><p align=left>
   The flow continued unabated and the kitchen was rapidly filling up with
beef and pork and chicken.  Purple, the Sensate and Krax were crushed and
buried.  The pitfiend tried to eat up the meat, but he wasn't fast enough. 
He choked to death as his mouth filled up with a tenderloin steak, a roast
chicken, three sausages and some bacon on the side.  Orion reached the
door and grabbed the doorknob, just as wave of meat cuts crashed down upon
him.
</p><p align=left>
   Meanwhile, Wishy was asking, "Does anybody know what happens if we fly
off the edge of Sigil?" 
</p><p align=left>
   "Uh, I think we'll be thrown off to a random plane," said Quake.
</p><p align=left>
   "How interesting!  Ya, let's do that!  HAL!"
</p><p align=left>
   A disembodied voice said, "Yes, Captain?"
</p><p align=left>
   "Take us outa here.  And off the edge of Sigil."
</p><p align=left>
   Narthe said, "I don't think that's such a good idea..."  The passengers
looked concerned, and muttered excuses for leaving the ship.  They began
to climb down.
</p><p align=left>
   Suddenly, the kitchen door burst off its hinges, followed by a flying
cornugon.  A heaving mountain of meat surged into the room, flooding the
tavern in seconds.  It continued out the door, spilling out into the
streets.  Even KK, the stone golem, fell under the onslaught.  The sea of
meat rose higher towards the ceiling.. and the ship.
</p><p align=left>
   Quake piped up, "OK, let's go."

<h3><font color=cyan>Character Descriptions</font></h3>
<font color=yellow><u>Mertian the Mindspider</u></font>  <i>(created by Mr. Niceguy)</i>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
He is an Aurumach, one of the high-up men of the
Rilmani race.  He's neither male nor female really, but takes either
gender (or neither) as needed.  For ease of pronouns, I've made him male
for the duration, so long as the duration isn't too long.  He maintains
lots of identities around town, one of which is the Cantha persona.
</p><p align=left>
His intelligence is literally godlike.  I tried to show that by having
him be able to monitor many threads of thought at once and to leap
quickly and intuitively to the right deductions, a la Holmes.  He should
never speak or think without doing so in three parts.  Three sentences,
three phrases, three thoughts, whatever.
</p><p align=left>
Obviously, he's my method of wrapping all the diverse threads of our
story together.  He'll be the central agent of defense when no one else
steps in.  He's the one out of the 99 aurumachs that exist that has been
specifically assigned to watch over Sigil and maintain it as a neutral
city, uninfluenced and uncontrolled by anyone.  If the Lady didn't
exist, he'd have to invent her.  Or did he already?  :)
</p><p align=left>
I've given him unspecified psionic powers, which isn't called for in
the statistics for aurumachs, but hey; these things are the Rilmani
version of layer lords, such as the abyssal princes and ba'atezu dukes.
A little individuality seemed called for.
</p><p align=left>
The mindspider is mostly a device to allow me that 'undetectable
observer' Ken was trying to eliminate.  :)  With a few exceptions, most
of the named characters so far have a doodad on them that is the
physical focus for an end of the mindspider's web.  Anything 'attached'
in that fashion is susceptible of having its thoughts and senses read by
the spider, and thus Mertian.  Two-way communication is possible only
briefly, and once.  That will burn out the thread after a few minutes.
</p><p align=left>
The exceptions are Cray, 'the shattered mage' (Delva/Abigail) and
Bliss.  Mertian can read each of these characters directly, and
communicate as well if he so chooses, without the mindspider's web.
</p><p align=left>
Notice Mertian's comments about Ilsensine.  His mental activities are
undetectable by mindflayers, and most all other psionics.  Cray is a
rare exception to this rule.  The Ilsensine connection is also why
Mertian can read Bliss directly.
</p><p align=left>
Cray and Mertian have some as-yet-unnamed unpleasant history between
them.  I haven't figured out what, just that neither likes the other
much.  Cray may not know many of Mertian's secrets, but he knows enough
to make Mertian nervous.  This doesn't quite leave us with the tragic
scenario Mr. Mooney first described, but there's still room for plenty
of pathos.  I don't know why, but I see Cray as the central character of
the story so far.
</p><p align=left>
There is also a mysterious history between Mertian and 'Delvagail' as
I've been calling her internally.  What, I don't know.  Just that
there's something afoot.  I've hinted that she was quite powerful when
she was sane.  I think Mertian is responsible for crippling her
mentally, and that the Pandemonium thing is an implanted memory, or a
part of Mertian's mind-breaking technique.  That's when he established
the link to her.
</p><p align=left>
Magic Items:  The 'universal portal key' that Mertian owns.  Pretty much does what 
it sounds like.  Very rare item, obviously, but since he can teleport 
anyway, it doesn't add much more than flavor to his character.
</p><p align=left>
  I realize I opened the door to this kind of thing by introducing
Mertian.  But he's not really a character, with hopes and dreams and
quirks.  He's a writer's plot device.  He's there to move the story
along.  And right now, I don't really expect him to live through this
story.  When his usefulness as a plot device is gone, I plan to bump him
off.  So if you must introduce more recurring characters (please don't
unless you *really* see the need for one, there are plenty running
around) please make them *characters* and not mere plot devices.
</p><p align=left>
Things were looking pretty grim for the ol' plot device.  So I 
  rebooted him.  Ditched the spied-upon digs, planted a new spider, and
  set traps for those who come along behind.  Shelaam wrote him nicely.
  Thanks for the trap development idea, buddy.  Oh, please remember to 
  write him as thinking and speaking in 'threes'.  I know its hard, so 
  if you don't want to do that but still want him in a scene, put him 
  into a disguised form.  Then you can write his dialogue however you
  like.  Also, I tried to show that he's *not* omniscient by having 
  the BCs be able to spy on him in the Astral without his knowledge.
  What else?  Oh, the Lair and the Universal Portal Key.  These are set
  to suck the whole lair into the Plane of Vacuum, breaking down all
  the portals and hipping whoever triggered the trap in the middle of
  nowhere.  I had not envisioned the Portal Key as being able to create
  portals, but merely able to manipulate them.  It's now pretty much out 
  of the picture, so no worries.  And the old mindspider is an obvious 
  trap for any too-curious BCs.  If one eats its brain, will Mertian get 
  a direct line to their thought processes?  And what would that do to 
  him?  Things to consider.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Nick Tanner</u></font>  <i>(created by Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
He's just as described, a petitioner who's essentially a nobody.  Just the 
typical cager, to give the man-in-the-street viewpoint of what's going on.  
Sort of local flavor.  I wanted a counterpart to Mertian, that cared about 
Sigil, but had NO power to spend in its defense.  All I ask is that he not 
die too quickly, I think its important to have a common-man viewpoint.
</p><p align=left>
I wasn't real happy with Nick charging out to do battle 
  with the invading forces.  So I backpedaled on his bravery, and then 
  shoved him into the midst of things against his will.  Nick is *not* 
  an adventurer or a hero.  He's a normal street-vendor who'd just like
  to see all this strangeness go away and have things get back to the 
  way they were.  I think Ken's mid-list comments about petitioners were 
  very insightful.  Maybe Nick can progress to *become* a hero, ala Luke
  Skywalker, but he's a long way from that now.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Durthelaxus the Dust Mephit &amp; Uriel the Deva</u></font>  <i>(created by Avi)</i>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
The deva is in some sort of trance and will not
think or act of his own free-will.  He follows *direct* commands and
answers *specific* questions with short answers.  He will not do anything
contrary to his good nature.  The trance is caused by powerful magic and
its cure will not be discovered any time soon.  Truth is, the deva can be
commanded by anybody, but the mephit makes it seem like only he can
command him and nobody has ever assumed otherwise.
</p><p align=left>
My take on their history (feel free to alter it): The deva was exiled over
some tragedy, captured by a fiend and sold as sex-slave to a succubus. 
She would torture him, then order him to heal himself, then torture him,
etc. Special fiendish magic made him into a zombie-like slave, but the
magic isn't powerful enough to overcome his good nature.  One day, the
mephit, messenger for the succubus, managed to steal the deva.  Now the
mephit has his own personal bodyguard-slave and jealously possesses him.
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
Uriel:  Recognizes Cantha somehow.  And not happily.  A prior connection 
  with Mertian?  Who knows?  I sense more possible background here.
</p><p align=left>
Durthelaxus:  Darn, I meant to say whether or not he got his wing and 
  hand back from getting more dust thrown on him.  Oh well. Someone else
  can decide that point.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Cray of the Bleak Cabal</u></font>  <i>(created by B. Mooney)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Cray is somewhat the tragic character. He's definitely got problems, and seems that he has
obligations.  It is likely that his intentions will not be the same as the 'party' in general.  
Oh, and Cray's comment about taking up the sword? Who knows...  When I
conceptualized him originally, I never really thought as to what class he
would be. But he is currently with a mage, a priest, and a psi. 
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
  I still think Cray's the hero of this story, although Sabrilla's
growing on me too.  Let's give the characters we've got a shot at
winning the day, huh?
</p><p align=left>
He's hitting an upswing in a manic-depressive curve at the end of
  my section.  I hinted that he's become a Bleaker after seeing too many
  people die for a cause, and I think that's behind his retirement from
  whatever warrior's life he once led.  And now he feels awful about
  dragging people into this sort of life once more.  Is that about what
  you'd pictured for him, Brian?  I've given him lots more chances for
  angst by forcing him to pick up a sword again.  I meant to write a 
  piece about his inner conflicts while staring at his old sword, but 
  ran out of time and space.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Blissziphelph ("Bliss") the Godsman</u></font>  <i>(created by Branno)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
The guy in the first part is a mind flayer that has left the ways of 
his people.  (yea, yea, bear with me here...)  He works for the Godsmen
(the guys who believe that ANYONE can rise in life to be something 
BETTER.) at Harbinger House as a 'mental counselor'.  He calls himself 
a Mind Friar (as in monk).  He uses his mental powers to help and 
console, rather than harm and maim.  (And, I figured that we need a 
'good guy' that could possibly confront these 'mental bad guys' 
mentioned in Ch. 2.  And no, he doesn't eat brains anymore...he has to 
feed on a special substance that he has concocted.  The 'components' 
to create this 'fluid' are VERY expensive and VERY rare, and luckily, 
he doesn't have to eat very often.  He struggles with his craving for 
the mental essence daily, but on a more philosophical level, not so 
much like 'Yum, Yum, more brains for me tum...'  Anyway, you get the 
idea.  (I hope!)  His name is Blissziphelph...call 'em Bliss for short.
</p><p align=left>
<i>[From Ian Watson]:</i>  Since he recognized Cray before, I decided 
that they know each other, and are familiar with each other.  Maybe not 
exactly friends, but then, who does have friends in Sigil?
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Tandin Swiftfoot</u></font>  <i>(created by Branno, expaned by Ken Lipka)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
I figured that we needed some heroes, however unlikely, on the other side, thus 
the Han-Solo like halfling, Tandin...
</p><p align=left>
<i>[From Ken Lipka]</i>  I agree that we need a hero in the Mazes to help us out.  However, 
I took Branno's phrase 'on the other side' literally.  I've broken with tradition and decided, 
at least in my mind, that Tandin is of evil alignment - most likely Neutral Evil.  (An "evil" hero, 
imagine that.)  This twist might allow him to successfully tag along with any enemy forces and get 
into Sigil by riding their coattails.
</p><p align=left>
Magic Items:  The 'maze key' that Tandin was given.  The silver wire glows like a 
portal to planeborn eyes and it leads out.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Braktuis the Orc</u></font>  <i>(created by Avi, named by Daniel Reddy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
The leader of the Orc band.  I view Orcs as being more than 
the traditional AD&D idea of "low level cannon fodder" and I liked the 
first chapter where the Orcs appeared.  Since Orcs are warriors, I 
thought it might be appropriate to use one.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Abigail/Delva, the Broken Mage</u></font>  <i>(created by B. Mooney, expanded 
by Daniel Reddy and Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
The homeless. Both Cray and Bliss struck me as caring types -
and I figured that they would not let her just run amuck without at
least attempting to help her.  It then occurred to me that she could be
a valuable asset to the group - once she was cured of her "Barmyness."
I'm figuring that Bliss could fix the problem (aka "Eternal Boundry"
style), but will leave that up to the future authors.
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
The most altered saved for last.  I think I now know who
  she is, but you all can certainly change that. I think she's Shekelor.
  I think Mertian was responsible for taking Shekelor out in the first
  place and that Cray and Co. are in for a major shock if/when they find
  Shekelor's Orb.  She'll get all her memories and real powers back, and
  may not be a very nice person at *all*.  I think Shekelor was too 
  powerful to kill outright, and that the best the Rilmani could do was 
  take away her memories and strand her body in Sigil.
</p><p align=left>
    What do you all think?  Like all ideas, this is subject to revision 
  and alteration.  Maybe she's Shekelor's daughter, maybe she's just 
  some poor sod the Rilmani used as a key to the orb.  But I think she's
  become important to the overall structure of the story, and since I've
  brought back the power Shekelor was looking for, why not Shekelor too?
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>"The Shadowed One"</u></font>  <i>(created by Ian Watson, expanded by Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
I decided to throw in an intelligent, subtle antagonist. 
The only "bad guy" we have in the story up to this point is the dergholoth
and maybe the voice that spoke to Cray.  Any particulars about him are left
up to future writers.
</p><p align=left>
<i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i> I made the watcher a rilmani cause the description really put me in
mind of the rilmani assassins, the cuprilach.  And I think its cool to
have Rilmani playing both sides of the street.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Sabrilla the Medusa</u></font>  <i>(created by Avi, named by Daniel Reddy, 
expanded by Ken Lipka)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
She is the owner and propriator of The Hammered Fist tavern.  She has a very firm "no fights" 
policy in her place and doesn't hesitate to use her natural petrification abilities to enforce it.  
She is something of a "rogue" in that she prefers to be around people and is willing to take efforts 
to do so (the glasses).  She is originally from Arborea near the burg of Here-Be-Monsters.  It was there 
that she met Cray several years ago.  This meeting proved to be the catalyst which caused her to finally 
risk leaving her home plane and travel, eventually ending up in Sigil.
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
  I took the hint that something "happened" between her and
  Cantha and expanded that out.  The "something" is still up for grabs 
  but I certainly made it look like an intimate relationship.  I think 
  the more she's written, the more complex a character she becomes.
  Maybe it's me, but the "I just like to petrify people" explanation she
  gave seemed like a front, a denial of more involved motivations.
  Thoughts?
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Kerjal</u></font>  <i>(created by Matt Oostman)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
	Tiefling mage. High level (8-11), high intelligence, above average
charisma, fairly high dexterity. Usually a nice enough guy but has a very
short temper when it comes to hurting his friends (or familiar [the ferret]).
He also carries a Staff of the Magi. In game terms his tie. abilities are the
standard ones (darkness 15' r, +2 vs. fire, cold poison, 1/2 dam. from cold,
ect.) His appearence gives him small horns on forehead, red eyes that he
can make glow (and automaticaly do when he's mad), blue-grey skin, an
opposable tail which remains hidden in his robes at all times, and under
normal sercomstances he casts no shaddow.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>G'kar</u></font>  <i>(created by Matt Oostman)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
	Half elven fighter/mage. Mid levels (7-9) Low charisma, above
average intelligence, exceptional strength. He wears a Belt of Hill Giant
strength (19). His sword is a great scimitar(2d6 dam, s-m) with magical
flame (2d4 fire dam. does NOT ignite flamable thing unless left in contact
longer then just getting hit with it) The sword was once evil and he fought
it's old posessor (undead knight) for it. After destroying the old weilder he
purified it and turned it good. (It was black, evil flame) When fighting
undead he'll sometimes have flashbacks. These can either be good or bad
for the group. (ie, good he fights harder, bad he might flee)
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Kerjal and G'Kar</u></font>  <i>(Matt Oostman)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
	Together they make an efficient battle team. They start in combat
by firing spells at the agressor if it's far away and then G'kar runs into the
melee while Kerjal covers him. The'll never split up if a group's deviding
and always go to the other's aid. The often have quarrels about things
they've already done but they usualy don't raise their voice and it never
comes to blows. In a tough situation it's like there minds are nearly linked
as they've traveled enough together to know what the other's going to do
by the look on his face or a back glance to the other.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Harpsichord</u></font>  <i>(created by Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
She's a priest/thief.  Total klepto, clinically so, but it doesn't interfere 
with her adventuring capability.  Speaks in cockney-cant.  I added her to 
spice up the serious Cray-Delvagail-Bliss trio.  As a hermes priest, she's CG, 
but I haven't thought much beyond that.  Is she a high priest?  Raise Dead could 
make for an interesting twist at some point.  I thought about it for the dead Githzerai and orc.
</p><p align=left>
Magic Items:  Possibly Harpsichord's staff.  I also thought that winged boots would be neat for her.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Mertian's Other Agents</u></font>  <i>(created by Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Zhertil (the Githzerai?) was named just to give his death a little more meaning.  Gogg
is around if anyone wants to use him, but I haven't given him much
thought.  He could just as easily never be heard from again.  Xanxost is
so much fun in Faces of Evil that I thought we might want to throw in a
slaad here, too.  I picture him linking up with Tandin, G'kar and
Kerjal, if with anyone.  Or he could join the bad guys.
</p><p align=left>
The last new characters are Iron Lily and Aqva'at.  These are ba'atezu
who will be leading part of the invasion.  Autumn Skye will introduce
them further in her part.  I talked to her to get a link into her piece
set up.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>F'chak'tor the Cambion</u></font>  <i>(created by KatClaw)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Pretty much just thrown into this by chance, the baatezu and tanar'ri           
were trying to lay claim to a portal to sigil's hive, strategically             
close to a very cheap, bulk weapons depot, and several caches. he hadn't        
been initailly given the command, only assumed command after his                
predascor (bad spelling i know) bought the burg (before the story blurb            
comes in on him slaying the spinagon)
</p><p align=left>
Only thing special about him is he has no love for the baatezu(of           
course) and has little love for the tanar'ri as well, as long as he gets        
his jink and/or power he's happy(which makes him a good candidate for a         
leading villian, seeing as how i am assuming the BCs will offer                 
something in return for the fiends service. the sword he slayed the             
baatezu with can either be normal, or magical, but i based it on the            
drawings in several PS books(page 3 in PSMCII shows a dagger base form)         
and gave it a special magic trait where(in game terms) on a roll of             
18-20 it sucesfully skewers the victims heart(or other vital organ) on          
the two inverse spike things(just woke up, lemme 'lone ;)                       
</p><p align=left>
I also figured that F'chak'tor was just the kind of cutter the BC's are 
looking for for their maze recruiting, doesn't care for the Baatezu, or 
the Tanar'ri and anything under that isn't even worthy of his time. 
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Jimora the Shadow Walker</u></font>  <i>(created by Lars Loeher)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Note: If you read this you might think that this class seems somewhat
overpowered, but always keep in mind the first section after the
question. Most of the really dangerous powers require deep concentration.
A slip here, a slight failure here and the shadow walker is scragged or
put into the dead book.
</p><p align=left>
  In addition the concept is from a high magic campaign world, where
every adventurer without mystic ability or at least a wild talent is
usually considered dead meat. (Besides it is war and people do get
killed in wars, but I didn't ask for it, mind you)
</p><p align=left>
  Jimora might be higher in level (speaking rpg-techincally) than most
of the other characters in the story, but most of the other characters
group, while she by nature of her profession cannot really become
member of a group, so she's got to be tougher to survive and do her
job. Just that it's assassinating bad guys.
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
  Muuuch more tolerable.  Still some hints of munckinism, (what
exactly is she using to kill all these fiends in one blow?) but the
character was much more stylish and coherent.  The Kender looked like a
random accumulation of powers.  Jimora seems to have a history and a
purpose that make sense.  And there's only so much one person with a
sword can do, which I tried to show in her segment.
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>The Kender</u></font>  <i>(created by Lars Loeher)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Treat the kender from this encounter as a powerful fighter/psionicist,
not as a your typical kender. Actually she has grown up among humans
or elves and adopted many of their values, but retained her quick
fingers. She uses them to free mages she deals with of the components
they need to cast slaying spells. (She also hands them back after the
deal is finished, or telekinetically transports them back to the
usually surprised mage if she doesn't trust him/her/it.)
</p><p align=left>
  I havn't named her jet, as I still have to see, what you might do
with her. You won't get rid of her. She has always enough psionic
energy stored in her body to get safely back there and still be well
shielded, when she astrally projects. If she is 'killed' or looses a
mental battle, her incarnation just dissolves. She uses strange and
little known psionic powers, that set even experienced psionicists on
the edge, so don't try to find this stuff in the AD&D rules.
</p><p align=left>
  As an illustration just how powerful she is, the kender went into an
area that was infested by illithids against all warnings. She defeated
their elder brain in mental combat and killed the confused mind
flayers before they reoriented themselves. What she doesn't know is
that she has actually drained the elder brain of most of its power and
knowledge - at least the portions that wouldn't drive her insane -
using a wild talent her mistress never told her she had.
</p><p align=left>
  For the warrior part, she is the leader of a legendary and successful
mercenary company on the prime. She had other planar adventurers. While
her warrior's philosophy is basically agreeable with the ciphers, she
joined the sensates, and came to know factol Erin Montgomery, who was
intrigued by the unusal female. They became friends and they still are,
even though they rarely meet. Originally operating from Krynn, she has
relocated her company (with the aid of powerful gating spells) to the
world of Toril, when the Chaos War started.
</p><p align=left>
  As the leader of this mercenary company, that only takes jobs to
fight opponents they know to be evil, and are still good enough to
make more than a living by it, she is often kept busy. So if you don't
want her around, don't bring her in. As another note she has perfected
the art of syncronizing swords and sorcery on the battlefield, to a
degree, that makes most generals and war leaders shiver in awe (or
fear of they are her opponents).
</p><p align=left>
  I think she might make some appearances investigating the dead
bodies and trying to find out what it is, and tracing the psionic
energies to the origins. (Hello Mindspider :) ) She doesn't really
actively do anything, except maybe somewhere nearer the end doing
mental battle with several Brain Collectors. (They are psionc?)
</p><p align=left><i>[From Mr. Niceguy]</i>
  On the subject of new characters:  Jimora & The Kender.  Ugh.  I'm
sorry, the Kender was too offensive to live. It was screaming 'Munchkin'
in big bold letters.
</p><p align=left>
  "I'm a psionicist capable of trashing elder brains who's such a
powerful warrior that I command a legion of mercenaries on my home world
(which isn't my home world, I moved) from which I'm astrally projecting
into Sigil (!!) so you can't kill me, but I can still use all my psionic
powers against you, nyah, nyah, nyah?"  And this monstrosity's a 
KENDER????
</p><p align=left>
  Puh-leeze.  Lady of Pain, I'd like you to meet the Kender.  Kender,
I'd like you to meet a humiliating death.  People who astrally project
into Sigil get what they deserve.
</p><p align=left>
  Note that the Kender's still around, though.  Since I couldn't take it
seriously, I decided to make it comic relief.  Who knows?  As a ghost,
Ms. Pinkbottom might be useful.  But no more of this 'I'm so tough, you

<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
    Next, having just got the MCA3, I felt it appropriate to put something
from there into the story.  Purguliss is an ooze sprite, a "thing" made of
ooze that communicates via sign language to "to those who understand".  I
doesn't say how those people speak back to the sprite, so I just assumed it
was a form of ESP or something.  Purguliss seems a little more helpful than
most Ooze sprites, so either he's a nice guy or he has some ulterior motive.
Maybe he'll follow our heroes through to Limbo.  On another note, seeing the
bubble apparently collapse and start filling up with ooze couldn't have been
very good for Harpsichord's claustrophobia.  And Delva's discomfort at the
ooze might very well have been something else....

And third (Love that rule of threes), the bit in the alley.  Strontian,
having seen what he had previously accomplished, would definitely have
figured out by now that the Factols weren't toast after all.  Also shows
that although he hides it well, he has a bit of a temper.  After all, he
"disposed of" his old intelligence.

<h3><font color=cyan>Short List of Places that have been described</font></h3>
<font color=yellow><u>Recent Additions #1:</u></font>  <i>(from Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Sigil's 'astral space':  I think you can enter the astral plane within 
  the city so long as you don't try to leave it.  And vice versa.  While 
  researching this part with the Guide to the Astral, I discovered that 
  BCs are mentioned on page 75 of that book as a potential monster to be 
  encountered on the Astral Plane.  So the speculations about the BCs 
  using the astral to manipulate the portals and mazes makes more and 
  more sense to me.  
</p><p align=left>
Feast & Famine:  Its main purpose was to get Cray's group from the 
  Lady's Ward, where he'd last been sent, to the Hive Ward, where the 
  ooze portals are.  I'm indicating that ooze portals aren't controlled 
  by the BCs, and are one of the three ways I see that people can get 
  out of Sigil without using a regular portal.  For the lowdown on ooze
  portals and what they do, check out In the Cage.  If you don't have 
  it, let me know and I'll post a summary to Ken for the Plot page.
</p><p align=left>
Voidjumper Inn:  The second way out of town.  Leap off the edge.  The
  Voidjumper usually is a bleaker/xaositect joint, where they can stare
  (or jump, as desired) out into the void beyond Sigil.  It's run by a 
  fat old Blue Slaad who thinks its funny watching mortals jump to a 
  random doom.  Someone mentioned on the list that given the infinite 
  qualities of the Abyss, most such leapers would land there.  So that's
  what happened to Aqva'at.

<h3><font color=cyan>General Story Plots and Ideas (in approximate order of submittal)</font></h3>
<font color=yellow><u>Overall Story/Plot:</u></font>  <i>(from Avi)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Here's my idea for a theme.  I've tried to include all the various ideas 
made so far.
</p><p align=left> 
A bunch of bitter rogue dabus have started the entire war.  They want the
Lady to be overthrown and don't really care who does it.  OR they've been
corrupted/brainwashed.  By working for the Lady, they've learned the
nature of the portals and how they function. 
</p><p align=left>
The dabus teach this to the Brain Collectors, whose alien outlook and
spell-like abilities gives them special insight into controlling the
trans-dimensional nature of the portals.  The race has its own alien
reasons for controlling Sigil, perhaps they want to move on from prime
brains to more enriching planar brains.  On their homeworld, a thousand
elder ones prepare for the event. They need lots of brainpower to control
the portals and it helps if the victim's brains are energized with fear or
hatred for the Lady of Pain.  It will be fairly easy to redirect the
portals, but it'll be hard to control them if the Lady is fighting back. 
No petty emotional squabbles (like those of humanoids) will prevent them
from combining their efforts. 
 </p><p align=left> 
The conquerors wait and wait until, at dawn of Day One in our story, the
Lady briefly leaves Sigil to create a new Maze in the Ethereal.  At that
moment, the brain collectors focus all their attention on trapping the
Lady in her Maze.  Everytime she tries to escape by using the portal or
creating a new one, they redirect the portal back on itself.  Outside of
Sigil, her centre of power, the Lady is hardpressed against the combined
efforts of a thousand elder Neh-Thelggu. 
 </p><p align=left> 
Meanwhile, the dabus visit the Mazes, under the pretense of checking on
things. They tell the embittered prisoners that the Lady has gone insane
and they lead them out of the Mazes to revolt or whatever.  Of course,
this portal actually leads to the homeworld, where they are eaten.  The
collectors are now empowered with the many brains of those who hate the
Lady.  This helps them to contain the Lady. 
 </p><p align=left> 
For the rest of the day, the brain collectors redirect all portals
(non-Sigilian side only) to the Mazes.  Anyone trying to enter Sigil, will
instead enter the Mazes.  They'll wonder what they did to deserve this. 
First confusion, then fear then anger towards the Lady.  Their brains will
become prime fodder for the brain collectors.  Then they will "luckily"
come upon an exit portal. 
 </p><p align=left> 
Portals in Sigil and portals in the Mazes are redirected to their
homeworld.  Anyone leaving Sigil or the Mazes will be eaten for their
brains. 
 </p><p align=left> 
Now, not all the Maze prisoners are tricked into slaughter.  The more
powerful evil ones are told the real plan, and they are allowed into Sigil
to impersonate the Lady and kill people.  A hundred different imposters go
on a murder spree throughout the day.  To the people of Sigil, it appears
that the Lady is killing people everywhere.  Many of the citizens flee
through the portals (why stay?), and their fear-filled brains feed the
brain collectors. 
 </p><p align=left> 
Then they redirect certain portals to allow armies of fiends to enter. 
The city falls into chaos.  More people flee from this wretched city, more
brains feed the collectors. 
 </p><p align=left> 
By the end of the day, the Lady has managed to beat even a thousand
collectors and entered Sigil, to find it half-empty, invaded by fiends,
and her name reviled.  Her own estrangement from the people makes it
difficult to unsoil her name.  In retaliation, she shuts down ALL portals,
cutting off Sigil from the rest of the multiverse.  No more fiendish
armies come in, but the citizens are still fighting off those who came
before. 
 </p><p align=left> 
However, the brain collectors have had many energized brains -- from
people who left the Mazes and from people who fled Sigil.  They begin a
powerful ritual that will open a single portal into the lair of an evil
Power.  The next day, a god will enter the city and slay the Lady. 
The characters have got to use all their ingenuity to stop this.

Brain collectors (Neh-thalggu in their own language) are rare creatures who
occasionally cross the barriers separating their distant home from the
Prime Material Plane.  Only near sources of great magical energy, where the
fabric of space and time is twisted, can they find small gateways to
Mystara, where they collect the brains of intelligent beings.

Each specimen of this hideous race has a yellow-orange body - bloated,
oily, and amorphous - with dozens of short, writhing tentacles. Six
crablike legs allow it to scuttle about.  Four large, yellow, bulging eyes
and a tooth-filled maw are set in its bulbous head.  The head may also have
a number of distinctive lumps (up to twelve), each one housing the brain of
another intelligent creature.

Neh-thalggu do not think like any other creature.  They speak their own
tongue and that of diaboli (see "diabolus") [a bunch of demonic
satyr-looking things, from the Demiplane of Nightmares, reportedly, that
really aren't bad.  Usually Chaotic Neutral].  They can also speak and
comprehend the languages known by any creature whose brains they've
swallowed.

COMBAT:  The brain collector's method of attack is a powerful bite with its
razor-toothed jaws, inflicting 1d10 points of damage with each bite that
hits.

Each brain collector can cast spells, depending on how many brains it has
collected.  Roll 1d12 to determine how many transplanted brains the monster
already has in its head.  Each transplanted brain can hold a single wizard
spell, no higher than 3rd level (these can be chosen by the DM or randomly
determined by dice roll; 1d3 for level and then according to wizard spell
lists).

A brain collector can attack with its bite or with a single spell in a
given round.  Although the nature of its intelligence is unfathomable,
brain collectors display a considerable tactical cunning in combat; they
will use their available spells to the best possible effect.

A brain collector takes great care as it fights, to avoid doing damage to
the cranium of its opponent.  As its name suggests, the brains of sapient
foes are very precious, indeed.

HABITAT/SOCIETY:  Though brain collectors have a completely alien
psychology, "chaotic neutral" is the alignment that best describes them. 
The Neh-thalggu do not have hostile intentions as such; rather, they do not
seem to regard humans or other humanoids as people.

Brain collectors are known to exist on the Demiplane of Nightmares, where
they hold a mythic position in the folklore of diaboli, like that of
dragons in human tales.  Diaboli regard Neh-thalggu as creatures of power,
cunning, and inscrutability, and brain collector magic can affect diaboli.

While Neh-thalggu exist on the Demiplane of Nightmares and the Prime
Material Plane, sages agree the creatures are native to neither.  Brain
collectors may also be found wandering other known planes, particularly the
Astral or Ethereal Plane.  On the Prime Material Plane, a brain collector
prefers ruins and caverns and other places with little light and infrequent
disturbances.

When a brain collector reaches the Prime Material Plane, it immediately
begins acquiring as many brains as it can, as quickly as possible.  Each
collector can store up to 12 brains at any one time.  When these creatures
slay humans, demihumans, or humanoids, they carefully cut away the top of
the head with surgical tools to expose the brain, and then swallow it.  The
swallowed brain then moves into one of the several pockets within the brain
collector's own head, forming a distinctive lump.  For each brain
collected, the creature gains the ability to cast one wizard spell of 1st
to 3rd level once per day.

When a Neh-thalggu has collected its 12 brains, it immediately seeks to
return to its home plane.  One theory holds that with 12 collected brains,
these monsters can, in certain locations, re-open the link to their native
world.  Fortunately, few 12-brain Neh-thalggu have been encountered; since
they can collect no more brains, they are more eager to move along than to
engage opponents.

The brain collector may be related in some fashion to the feyr (described
in the Monstrous Manual).

ECOLOGY:  Brain collectors have no interest in treasure of any kind;
denizens of the Prime Material Plane are curious objects for dispassionate
study and ruthless exploitation - cattle, in the brain collectors' eyes.

Neh-thalggu are predators of the highest order, but they exert little
influence on the Mystaran environment.

Tailor fit as you desire, this is a story.  (:

Okay, details. Since we've moved on to anti-peak (midnight), beginning of 
the next day, I figured it would give the group time to trek around and 
deliver the messages to about half of the factions. I envisioned them 
taking the Gatehouse first, then moving around to the Hall of Records, 
Civic Festhall, etc. leaving them out by the Grand Bazaar.  I didn't plot 
it out exactly, so anyone wanting to tackle a particular place (such as a 
party at the Festhall) has an opportunity.
</p><p align=left>
I figured if any were interesting it would likely be the Shattered Temple 
(and yeah, I'm an Athar freak) for the fact that if the Portals are 
shutting down, somebody's got to be thinking about that dead god, claiming 
Aoskar's revenge. But who knows?  I would've written it, but the timing

OK, Durthelaxus wouldn't have time to check out the whole tavern, but what 
happened is that a nighthag (or yugoloth) came through the portal with an 
army of hordlings.  This is one of the invading armies obviously.  I don't 
know what'll happen to the mephit and Uriel.  The mephit is sorely wounded 
and lost consciousness, not necessarily dead.  So he can be captured (and 
the nighthag needs a damn good reason to keep them alive) or Uriel 
momentarily snaps out of his enchanted trance (because of the unusual 
urgency of the situation) and teleports them away somewhere.  I guess the 
two hordlings attached to the mephit would come along as well.  I'm not 
aware of any magic powerful enough to un-meld their flesh, simple healing 
wouldn't do it, so maybe he needs to cut off his hand and the tip of his 
wing.
</p><p align=left>
If I've made the situation difficult, well, I don't believe in stories 
where everything is easy for the characters.  This Sigil invasion is very 
very dangerous; people will get injured and several should die.
</p><p align=left>
You'll notice that I've emphasized the chaos in the streets, the thousands 
of people evacuating the city and therefore feeding the brain collectors.
</p><p align=left>
I also suggest having one type of invading army per ward.  ie., the 
hordlings in whatever ward contains the Hammered Fist.  Tanar'ri in 
another ward, baatezu in another, etc.  I think its neat that way.
</p><p align=left>
I have an idea for how the Lady imposter will work.  People are 
pholymorphed to resemble a woman and dressed like the Lady (pholymorph vs 
illusion cuz many planars have good resistance to illusion).  Using magic, 
the imposter hovers in the air, or maybe the pholymorphed imposter is 
really a renegade dabus with natural hovering power.
</p><p align=left>
With the imposter, are alot of bladelings or warriors with sharp magic 
swords.  They're under improved invisibility and silence spells, or even 
better, dust of disappearance which no planar can detect.  The imposter 
looks at a victim, at which point the invisible warriors close around him 
and slash him up at once.  To the observer, it looks like a Lady has 
killed him with her gaze.  There's a whole bunch of these imposters and 
invisible warriors, and I have no clue where they get all these spells and 
kegs of dust of disappearance.

<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
This is only a theory, but I felt that it was a fairly sound one.  It 
could be some sort of strange resonance effect resulting from the 
Brain-bad-guys' magical and mental energies that are being expended in 
order to 'subvert' all of these portals (which would seem to be QUITE a 
great deal of energy, IMHO).
</p><p align=left>
At any rate, it gives those within the maze something other to do than 
run around from bad-guys, and it also gives them a direction to head 
towards, i.e. a possible way out.  My original idea was that a GREAT 
number of 'resonating portal keys' would have to be gathered before 
*ANY* attempt at creating an 'artificial' portal could even be 
attempted.  Also, I figured that it would be good to work in two other 
aspects as this 'thread' of the story continues (if it, indeed, does) 
</p><p align=left>
1.	Not all portal keys (for whatever reason, mainly the whim and 
folly of the multiverse) do not resonate or echo with their 'old' 
energy.  I would figure, in this case about 20% would, while all the 
others would be 'spent'.
</p><p align=left>
2.	I thought that it might be good to work in some rare component 
that would be discovered (perhaps by a high-up divination spell) in 
order to get the final 'Portal-Opening Spell' to work.  I also figured 
that it would be groovy to work in the component as 'the hair of a 
nightmare', or some such element of a nightmare, thus tying the spell 
back in with the nightmare that Tandin conjured to fight the 'loth...

I've indicated that intra-city portals still function. 
The bad guys haven't blocked them, just the ones that lead in and out of 
town.  If we want to change that later, its easy.  It must take time to 
block all those portals.  I've also corroborated that personal mazes are separate from the ones 
controlled by the bad guys, and still exist as the lady made them.

  Cray's mission is now set out clearly.  Alert the factols by dawn

  I've tried to play down the brain collector aspect and play up the 
fiend part.  I thought the 'master plan' was to reveal the BCs slowly, 
and at the rate we were going, they'd be on scene and fighting in the 
next chapter.
</p><p align=left>
  I've tried to solidify our good guys into three distinct groups.  I 
meant to add Stefan from the Hammered Fist into the mephit-medusa-deva 
group, and make him a rogue, but didn't have the time.  I was aiming at 
3 groups of 4 members, but missed the target a bit.  Oh well.
</p><p align=left>
  What else?  Oh, yes, almost forgot.  Insanity.  As I wrote, it seemed 
to loom more and more as something that might be critical somehow.  Thus 
the addition of Harpsichord.  Cray's little group is all a little off

minds?  Just wonderin'.

<font color=yellow><u>Generic Plot Suggestion #4:</u></font>  <i>(from Ken Lipka)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
	OK, here's the notes on what I was trying to do with my segment of
the story.  Basically, I was playing a mid-list Mr. Niceguy.  I went back
and found some story threads that hadn't been touched for a while and
brought them back to keep them from getting lost.
</p><p align=left>
	The first bit deals with F'chok'tor, the cambion general.  When we
last saw him, it was Peak on Day One and he had just accepted a deal from
the Brain Collectors to help them with their plans for Sigil.  Rather than
leave him in the Maze, I decided that the BCs would want him to lead a
force of some kind against Sigil.  So, I decided that they would have let
him out with money and magic scavanged from victims to assemble a legion.
Thus, the scene in Plague-Mort.
</p><p align=left>
	My ideas on how people can work with this is that this force is
how Tandin and friends can get out of the Mazes.  They can either follow
the charging hordes as they are led through the Maze to get to the exit
into Sigil, or they can waylay a few of the attackers to assemble some
more keys to build their own exit.  I am sort of picturing that all
portals into Sigil lead through one or two Mazes, so that this troop will
quite possibly pass through where our heroes are.
</p><p align=left>
	The second segment was done to provide an alternate way of getting
out of the Maze if people don't like the first idea.  Some one mentioned
possibly needing the tail of a nightmare for the spell.  Well, here's a
way to get to it.  I figured that a Dergoloth could beat a Nightmare in
combat, but it wouldn't come out scot free.  So, we now have a firm
resolution to what was posted before, as well as a method to get some
personal combat into the story if someone wants to write such a thing.
Also, it's a convienent way of getting the spell component to the heroes,
rather than "wasting" time by having them search for it.
</p><p align=left>
	The third piece goes back to our "man on the street" again.  I
agree with Niceguy in that we do need to have some viewpoint of the
"normal" man in the story as kind of a barometer as to how things are
going over all.  I decided to address what happened to him since yesterday
as well as provide an idea of what was going on in the city.  I figured
that the factions would take the opportunity to take the Kreigstanz out
into open warfare.  I also hinted at some of the other forces that would
be at work in the city as well.  And yes, I did intentionally directly
copy the open paragraph from Niceguy's work.  It's done as a literary
technique to emphasize the differences in the city.  Also, it does help
reinforce Nick's petitioner nature (they are kind of programmed to do the
same thing every day).  I figure we can probably end the story with an
entry from Nick going through his morning routine and having it work.
</p><p align=left>
	As a side note, I realize now that it might have been a bad idea
to press for a new day to start up with the beginning of the list.  We
don't have nearly enough writers now to make this feasible - unless, of
course, you all start writing more segments to make sure the time gets
filled in properly.

                       The Shadow Walker Class

</pre><p align=left>
Now, What In The Name Of The Nine Hells Is A Shadow Walker?
</p><p align=left>
  Pratically they are very dangerous good-aligned assassin, as their
magical adept powers do only work when focussing on the good of
others, and the people they help by slaying someone. Naturally they
will only slay evil beings. Their magical enhancements malfunction if
the target isn't evil or has strong evil tendencies. Needless to say,
they are exceedingly rare.
</p><p align=left>
  Technically another character class.
  Shadow Walkers are a Rogue Subclass.
</p><p align=left>
  I minimize racial restrictions on classes, so PCs of almost any race
can become a shadow walker with the exception of dwarves and
earth genasi. (some saurials might be excluded too. Use common sense,
the shadow walkers are graceful, swift and silent, and some races just
don't have these traits, so they can't become shadow-walkers.)
</p><p align=left>
  There are no level limits. I don't use this rule. (gives pesky humans
too much power.) Make it up yourself if you want to use it.
</p><p align=left>
  Shadow Walkers have the following Thieving Skills:
</p><p align=left><pre>
  Hide In Shadows       20
  Move Silently         15
  Open Locks            15
  Climb Walls           30
  Escape Bonds          15
  Rope Manipulation     20
  Create Poison         10
  Cryptography          05
</pre></p><p align=left>
  Beginning shadow walkers may spent 40 points to increase their
thieving skills and another 20 witch each level they gain. None of the
ratings may naturally exceed 99%
</p><p align=left>
  Shadow Walkers gain thieves' backstab damage multipliers.
</p><p align=left>
  Shadow Walkers may only be of Neutral Good and Chaotic Good
alignment. Alignment changes of Shadow Walkers may only be caused by
the character (role-playing) or by divine intervention and artifacts.
Usual alignment changing powers don't work.
</p><p align=left>
  Any change of Alignment to any other than those above (being
assassins they cannot be lawful good) causes the shadow walker to
loose all adept powers listed below.
</p><p align=left>
  Shadow Walkes may use all weapons allowed to thieves and can stand
their own in a fair fight too if they have to, but they prefer the
silent method.
</p><p align=left>
  Being adepts, Shadow walkers gain the following magical abilities, as
they advance in level:
</p><p align=left><pre>
  2:Skill Boost
    * A single thieving skill of the Character's (player's) choice is
      increased by 50%
    * For every three levels anothe skill may be temporarily boosted,
      that is two at level five, three at level eight, four at level
      eleven and so on.
  7:Shadowform
    * The shadow walker becomes a shadow and is 90% invisible in all
      but the brightest sunlight or equivalent thereof.
    * The shadow walker had to materialize completely to hit anything.
    * In shadow form the shadow walker is intangible and cannot be hit
      by normal weapons. For magical weapons only the bonus is dealt
      as damage. Spells do normal damage.
    * At level twelve the shadow walker may only partially re-
      materialize to do damage, but at least half of the body is
      exposed. If there is sufficient shadow (DM's choice, the
      shadow walker may (instead of a second attack) become a shadow
      again.
  12: Shadowport
    * At this level of power the shadow walker may teleport from one
      shadow to another in sight once a day.
    * At level 17 the shadow walker may transport herself to any
      shadow in a place she has seen before. If there ain't sufficient
      darkness, the transport fails. Transport is without error, but
      may never cross planar borders (or break through the Sigil
      teleport shield.)
    * At level 21 they may cross planar bounderies, except Sigil of
      course.
  16: Silent Death
    * At this level, shadow walkers may slay without rematerializing
      and do damage as though they where magical creatures in respect
      to what they can hit unarmed or with their dagger.
    * Who said assassins fight fair? not even good-aligned ones do.
  ??: Shadowstorm
    * It is believed, that truely powerful shadow walkers may cause a
      maelstorm fucussed on a group of evil beings, that slays every-
      thing within and tendrils jet out to destroy other evil beings.
      This power is at minimum gained at level 25.
    * In addition it is also believed that this storm draws on energy
      from the negative energy plane and the plane of shadow and
      doesn't work in the outer planes.

  There is another type of similar assassin adept, that is thouroughly
evil. They are called Nightstalkers and those who survive their trials
for some time are extremely dangerous. They are versatile, usually
unpredictable and devious. Nightstalkers don't care for plots, only
for their jobs, and they take jobs from all sides and have the skill
to live through it. People like dealing with them about as much as they
like dealing with Yugoloths.

<font color=yellow><u>The Hive Theory:</u></font>  <i>(from Lars Loeher)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
The theory the kender told Erin about is about the lady of pain, the
dabus and Sigil in general. The basics of it are pretty simple:
</p><p align=left>
  The cage is a hive. The dabus are the workers of the whole thing,
mending everything and keeping it running. Somewhere deep beneath the
surface of the city (there is a tunnel system, it's mentioned somewhere
in the source material, but I don't remember where) lies a great
chamber, where three beings are. One co-ordinates the drones (dabus),
another co-ordinates the warriors (always cloaked in illusions) and
the third breeds drones and warriors. (Laying eggs wich are tended by
drones until they hatch, then the younglings are instructed by their
respective group.
</p><p align=left>
  Because they basically sit at the heart of the city, the three know
everything that is going on anywhere in the cage. (Maybe the cranium
rats are their spies.) If something goes horribly wrong, they create
the illusion of the LoP and sent a group of their warriors there, who
take care of the problem. No-one knows what the warriors really look
like, but those who made up this theory think it ain't anything nice,
being able to shred everything the way they do.
</p><p align=left>
  The three beings themselves are only an incarnation of the mind of
the city itself, which needs an executive arm. (This mind cannot be
dominated, neither can the LoP...) These three beings aren't immortal,
so they have to find successors on occasion. This one of the beings
then gives birth to a small parasitic being that crawls into someone
and they finally change and then disappear. On the other hand maybe
the parasite just grows within them and bursts out of them.
</p><p align=left>
  (Maybe I have been watching Alien 4 too recently :) )
</p><p align=left>
  It's just a theory. I actually have another idea, what is really
going on, but I will just see if it fits, when my turn comes again,
or my turn after that... (If it doesn't I will keep it for another
plot.)

If you deciede to keep Jimora around, I will write up an background
for her too. It's just that she seems so powerful compared to the
other characters, and you might think she is unbalancing the story. On
the other hand I might not have made the disadvantages of the Shadow
Walker class obvious enough. While they are powerful, they have many
flaws and are simply extremely hard to play them (or write about
them) the way they are supposed to be.
</p><p align=left>
  I didn't write a more personally involved section about the battle
for two reasons. First it would have been a lot longer than it already
is. Second I wasn't feeling fiendish enough to write it from the
cambion's perspective. Someone else might write what he thinks about
the battle in retrospective. That's of course only my suggestion. Do
with it what you want.
</p><p align=left>
  On the Kender's Statement: Only Astral Projection (the kender uses
something similar, but it is an IMAGE, not a direct projection of her
self) into the cage works. Since planar "ghosts" cannot really do
anything except talk, it is not much of the problem. The teleport
lock is still securely in place. (The kender may use psionics from
her "Spell Image", as though she where there herself.)
</p><p align=left>
That's it for now. I hope the story section is good enough to fit with
the rest, and the C&P sections are sufficient. If the latter are not,
feel free to ask. I will just watch and see what you do with it. It's
a chain story, so that's only my section and I will read along what
happens and work with that when my turn to write comes around another
time. On a second thought, maybe I shouldn't have introduced a new
character (or were it two? :) )...
</p><p align=left>

<font color=yellow><u>Generic Plot Suggestion #6:</u></font>  <i>(from Shelaam)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
Starting the story in Mertian's lair, I felt the need (both for my
direction and the coherency of the story) to distill far-flung facts in
order to see what is important from our erstwhile hero's perspective. As
what I've written here is obviously rather important as a sort of summary
so far, if any of it is wrong please say, so that it can be altered.
</p><p align=left>
Apart from that, a couple of Mertian's musings could use an explanation of
what I intended (though probably different from what they will eventually
come to mean ;). Regarding the infiltration of his network, I believe that
Mertian doesn't know how badly he has been compromised - the bottom of Page
1 suggests that our mysterious watcher is either a Rimlani turned rogue or
one working legit but at cross purposes (perhaps the entire war is nothing
but a test of Mertian's capability). Either way, the enemy knows more about
Mertian than he thinks.
</p><p align=left>
Secondly, the issue of the Lady, which is the central thread of my segment.
Mertian's third, unprinted, possibility is that the Lady is still in
control, but her strange behavior is a deception and a defense against a
dire threat. Being a bit of a Lady worshiper myself, this is the course I
led the story on.
</p><p align=left>
I theorized that the reason for the massive fiend invasions of Sigil was to
provide a huge number of deaders who's brains could be collected by the
likes of our little crablike friend (under the guise of psionic
invisibility or suchlike) and taken back to the Elder Brain to fuel its
strength. What the Lady is doing is letting the baddies think they have
control of the portals and creating her own huge bunch of deaders - but
ones which will give our friends a slight case of indigestion.
</p><p align=left>
A crackpot plan? We shall see.
</p><p align=left>
By the way, I had no idea of what a Brain Collector was supposed to look
like, so I turned my cunning little pet hermit crab into the villainous
footsoldier. No doubt the Elder Brain will look like my girlfriend ;)

for all you know, might simply be the amalgation of the BC's collective.  I
prefer a deity-like coordinating force though- kind of like what Mertian's
doing, only for the would-be conquerors of Sigil).    
</p></font></blockquote><br>

<font color=yellow><u>Generic Plot Suggestion #8:</u></font>  <i>(from Mr. Niceguy)</i><br>
<blockquote><font size=2><p align=left>
  The only people who've probably been doing things other than what I've
detailed in the evening/night of day 2 are Nick and F'chak'tor.  I
expect Nick's just wandering around lost in the dabus warrens and
F'chak'tor is being real careful around Kadyx.  But I had other writing
duties to attend to, and couldn't catch everything.  
</p><p align=left>
  I've gotten all our heroes together in one group or another (or
pointed them at each other at least - I'm thinking of Pathosis here) and
assigned new missions.  Since they were all in Sigil now, I thought it
was time for them to deliver their reports to Mertian and bump the plot
forward a tad.  Time marches on!
</p><p align=left>
  The second main thing I had to attend to was to explain the 'little
change' dropped on us by Yingzhi.  I think he's right, there needed to
be a co-ordinating force for the bad guys, so I've tried to make the
enemies hierarchy a little more clear.
</p><p align=left>
  To be totally specific, here's a table:<pre>

                        Transcendent Enemy        <--
                         /             \             \
                Brain Collectors       Strontian the Soulsnake
                 /          \                 / (?)
       Attacking Fiends   Dominated Factioneers
         /        \
  (F'Chak'tor)   Iron Lily
                      \
                     (Aqva'at)</pre>
</p><p align=left>
  F'chak'tor isn't really working for the BCs any more and Aqva'at is
compromised as an agent for the aggressors.  Strontian is using the
Transcendent Foe for his own ends and thinks he's at the top of the
pyramid.  He may/may not have influence over the dominated factioneers.
</p><p align=left>
  On that subject:  Lars hinted that the bad guys were trying to get
control over the factions by getting the behind-the-throne powers under
their thumb, and I ran with that.  The whole sequence with Cuatha
(Erin's boytoy/bodyguard) was written to show that he's now playing on
the visitor's team.  Make of this what you will.
</p><p align=left>
  The Watcher in the Shadows has now been named: Strontian the
Soulsnake.  Thanks to Arawn for providing the inspiration.  I envision
the soulsnakes doing the same sort of thing that the mindspider does,
only with some nasty side effects.  This means that Strontian's got an
eye on Cray and Co. and that Delva/Abigail may be a potential future
traitor.  More on her later.
</p><p align=left>
  I don't know whether Strontian is an aurumach or a lower ranked
Rilmani shooting for promotion.  It's clear he wants Mertian's job
though.  I currently see him as sort of a wild-card back-up to the main
thrust of the invasion.
</p><p align=left>
  Iron Lily and Aqva'at:  I've moved the ba'atezu army closer to hitting
town and gave a reason for why the ba'atezu haven't attempted anything
like this before.  They should impact Sigil at Peak on Day 3, and make
quite an impact indeed.  I don't know how *big* this army is, though. 
Any ideas?  
</p><p align=left>
  I made Aqva'at more of a screw-up than perhaps Autumn had intended,
but we can always redeem him with a bit of cleverness later on.  And if
he can get his message through that they're all being duped, Iron Lily's
Legion could even end up working against the general invasion plan.
</p><p align=left>
  Brain Collectors:  I wrote the bit with Pathosis mainly to correct
Shelaam's description of the buggers.  The description I used was
essentially the one provided in the Mystara Monstrous Appendix.  Can
anyone scan the picture provided in that appendix and get it to Ken for
use on the plot page?  I *might* be able to, but if you've got a scanner
and the book, you're a scanner ahead of me.
</p><p align=left>
  Also, Stefan's description of them adds some powers not indicated in
the Monster Appendix.  Specifically, I've given them the immunity to
magic that Diaboli have.  Unless you're from their level of reality,
your magic doesn't hurt them directly.  It's like unfailing MR. I figure
the magic thingies Kerjal recovered are powerful enough to be able to
affect them, though.
</p><p align=left>
  The Transcendent Enemy:  OK, this is the *really* new part.  Yingzhi
alleged that the big bad guy was behind the destruction of two entire
planes countless millenia ago.  About as bad as a bad guy can get.  More
powerful than powers.  Verrry hard to write around if he's in the fight
slugging.  But beaten once before by the Rilmani.
</p><p align=left>
  So what I did was take a bit of 'official' legendry and insert it
here.  I've decided that the person/force Yingzhi created should be the
one that's alluded to in the Shekelor plot revealed in Uncaged:  
</p><p align=left>
  Shekelor was a mage who, 10,000 years ago, tried to wrest Sigil from
the Lady.  He was failing, (but not by a lot) so he then went to let
loose an even *greater* force that had almost beaten her millenia before
*his* time.  Shekelor got scragged before he succeeded, and his mind/
spirit is supposed to be contained within a gem/orb on Pandemonium.
</p><p align=left>
  There can't be that many forces so powerful as to have a real shot at
taking over the Cage, so I've combined Yingzhi's bad guy with the one
that Shekelor sought.
</p><p align=left>
  To account for the transcendent foe's power level, I've said that it
comes from a 'higher' plane.  For anyone with Doors to the Unknown, a
similar idea was used for the villain in that plot.
</p><p align=left>
  I've postulated that there are planes even farther 'out' than the
Outer Planes.  These are even more abstract than the Great Ring, and
*exceedingly* difficult to get to (and from) physically.  Diagram:<pre>

	Inner Planes
	     |     (ethereal as buffer)
	Prime Plane
	     |     (astral as buffer)
	Outer Planes
	     |     (astral as buffer???)
	Ascendant Planes
	     |     (no soddin' idea what the buffer is)
	Transcendent Plane</pre>
</p><p align=left>
  I've contradicted written TSR material by making the Demi-plane of
Nightmares (which is where the Brain Collectors come from) one of these
ascendent outer planes rather than a demi-plane in the Ethereal.  I also
moved the mercurials from Doors to the Unknown up to this level, too,
just to show that there are more inhabitants of higher reality than the
ones we're seeing in the story.
</p><p align=left>
  The big Enemy comes from a plane even farther 'out' than the one the
BC's come from.  I see Transcendence as being the plane where the Forces
and Overpowers reside, like Death and Ao and the like.  The last stop on
the line, this is as powerful as its possible to get and still be able
to interact with planars at all.  Things so powerful that powers are
like playthings or children to them.  Like the critters in the Cthulhu
mythos, things from Transcendence are just more real than lesser beings
can deal with.
</p><p align=left>
  While the Enemy's bad enough to snuff any of the other characters by
just breathing hard, I think he isn't really able to get into the Great
Ring to do the kind of damage he wants.  The whole point of this
exercise from the Enemy's p.o.v. is to get control of Sigil long enough
to open a portal that he *can* translate his incomprehensible energies
through.  *Then* we'd be facing a situation like the one Mertian saw in
the ancient Mimir on the plane of vacuum.

Tandin, Durthelaxus, Uriel and (I hope) Pathosis:  Check out the Dabus 
  warrens for some indication of what's going on with the Lady.  I still
  don't have a feeling for what her problem is, but this seemed like a 
  cool location to set some scenes in, and I wanted to see some 
  interaction between Tandin and Durthelaxus.  Oh, and with Nick already
  in the Dabus warrens, this gives us a chance for our man-in-the-street
  to watch some other characters in action.
</p><p align=left>
Sabrilla, Stefan, Kerjal & G'kar:  Look for BCs doing nasty stuff to 
  faction high-ups and stop them.  I have no idea at all where this will 
  go, it just felt like something that needed to be done.  If the BCs 
  gain control of some factions, the Kriegstanz might *really* heat up!
</p><p align=left>
Cray, Delvagail, Bliss & Harpsichord:  They're off to find the wizard...
  But are likely to get lost along the way.  Maps through Limbo don't 
  sound too reliable to me.  In addition to the Shekelor plot thread, 
  this gives us a chance to describe some other planes, which should be
  fun.  Wonder how they're supposed to get back when they find the orb?
</p><p align=left>
Jimora:  Find and take out the Soulsnake.  Difficult to do, considering
  no one on the good guys' side even knows who he is, where he's at, or 
  what he's doing.  But this seemed like the appropriate task for Lars' 
  shadow assassin.
</p><p align=left>
Bimbalina Pinkbottom, dreaded mercenary captain:  Stay dead.  :)  
  Seriously, if you've got a good use for this character, then go to it. 
  Just because I can't think of one doesn't mean she doesn't have *some* 
  good quality.
</p><p align=left>
Nick Tanner:  (from his p.o.v.)  Try not to get into any more trouble.  
  Get out of the dabus warrens in one piece.  And never touch any more
  glowing crystal dinguses.
</p><p align=left>
Iron Lily:  Get to the portals of the Forest of Weeping Doors before 
  Peak tomorrow.  Flog the living daylights out of Aqva'at if he shows 
  up.  She'll probably drop everything to try and kill F'chak'tor once 
  she finds out he's in Sigil.  (IMO)
</p><p align=left>
Aqva'at:  Catch up to Lil and tell her the news without getting killed.
  Try and figure out who's peeling whom in all this, and then make that
  knowledge work for you.
</p><p align=left>
Mertian:  Follow up on what everyone else is doing.  Try not to be too
  deus ex machina.  Go back and spy on the Lady some more?  Stay low.
</p><p align=left>
The Lady of Pain:  Still active and killing *some* intruders.  I tried

firmly put Cray into the leadership role here.  At this point, all of
the characters have questioned themselves in exactly why they are going
off on this damn fool quest, but all seem willing to follow Cray.  A
strong leader is necessary for a quest such as this, especially when the
madness of Pandemonium hits.
</p><p align=left>
Delva - The whole bit with Delva is more of the infection of the
Soulsnake - Bliss is beginning to pick up the disturbing ripples, but he
can't put a mauve-colored finger on it just yet.

Harpsichord - I figured that adding another psychosis to this lovable
character would really make things interesting - particularly in the
caverns of the Howling plane.

Bliss - more than ever, he will become the binding of the group, and
will be the one to act as a liaison (if needed) between Cray's eccentric
way's and the group.
</p><p align=left>
Cray - I was not sure exactly what class Cray is, so I took the safe
route here.  Basically what he is trying to do is contact one of the
lower-rung natives of this plane - hopefully a mephit (as they are
*very* willing to please for a garnish or two).  There are several ways
that this can be explained.  One - if he's a cleric or mage - by spell.
If he's a psiconist - by power, if he's none of the above, well, his
formidable (but latent) mental powers have already been referred to
several times, we could say that due to his (or his tiefling background)
he has this particular power.

Second segment - Tandin, Durthelaxus and Uriel<br><br>
I had really wanted to get to the Dabus warrens this time, but the DM in
me would not let them get by without at least one random encounter.
After all, the Hive Ward is practically brimming with fiends.  This was
more of an illustration on how this group knows how to use their heads
(and their pouches as well) to get out of a scrape.  After all, this
*is* the planes, and not *everyone* has a super-powerful magical spell
that they brought with them from the *Prime*.

	We last saw him on Late Afternoon of Day 2.  I felt the need to bring him into the current timeline.  I was primarily working from the idea of Mr. Niceguy about letting Nick see some of our heroes in action.  My idea for the plot is that the group of Tandin, Uriel, Druthelaxus, and Pathosis would be entering the Dabus Warrens by one of the portals in Nick's chamber, and then leave with him in tow.   Of course, it's also possible that Nick might get out on his own and meet the party elsewhere in the Warrens.  I'm kind of thinking that the key to the portals is some phrase of Dabus-speak.
</p><p align=left>
2)  Uriel, Tandin, Dru, Pathosis, & 187<br>
	This is the main goal of my segment.  First, I wanted to get all of our heroes together so that future writers only have to deal with a minimum of groups.  Second, I wanted to start compiling all of the information for the readers as well as ourselves.  The next segment written involving this group could be the conversation of sharing information.  This will allow us to layout the entire plot to the readers, at least as far as the characters know it.
</p><p align=left>
	If I were to keep writing this, I'd have a tough decision to make.  See, we've just seen that Pathosis is high enough level to cast Animate Dead.  This also means that he's high enough level to cast Speak with Dead.  If I were writing, I'd have Tandin or Dru make the off-hand comment about not being able to capture and interrogate one of the BCs in order to find out exactly where they are and what they're up to.  At this point, Pathosis would smack his forehead and go "doh!" and remember that he CAN ask the BCs what's up.
</p><p align=left>
	At this point, we'd have the joy of determining what questions would be asked - essentially how much of our overall plot do we want to reveal at this point.  However, I got sick of writing and I didn't want to make a decision.  So, some one else gets to decide if Speak with Dead is a valid option.  :)
</p><p align=left>

* Ghosts are creatures of emotion and are more severely affected by them

<i>Second Section</i><br>
  Jimora engages and opposed assassin, read it for yourself.
</p><p align=left>
<i>Third Section</i><br>
  Bimb's notices that she still has her military knowledge and Erin asks
her to use it in the ongoing war effort. She explains something more about
her state and what happened to her.
</p><p align=left>
<i>Fouth Section</i><br>
  Resolving Jimora vs. the Night stalker.
</p><p align=left>
  (If you don't recall here a short reminder: Night Stalkers are twisted
evil and depraved versions of Shadow Walkers and have similar abilities.
Obviously they are also the Shadow Walker's most dangerous (and
hated) enemies.)
</p><p align=left>
  This nightstalker (as section six reveals) is one of the rare unfortunate
sods, who have been forced (Geased or something) into their role, but being
possessed by soul snake he appeared as corrupt as the next Yugoloth, the
only release being death.
</p><p align=left>
  BTW (The minions), Jimora doesn't care much for mercenaries of their
type, but usually she tries to hit only evil beings, but sometimes she
obviously can't. Humans make mistakes on occasion after all. (Her training
prevents the worst, but...)
</p><p align=left>
<i>Fifth Section</i><br>
  Here we learn of the fate of Bimb's body and the missing part of her
mind. Either part can only exist for a limited time without being reunited.
(I know I didn't mention it within the story, but my seg's already long
enough as it is. I could have gone on longer. You would lynch me then,
right?)
</p><p align=left>
  In addition it is shown that the thing that sliced the Kender's
silver cord up might quite well not have been the LoP, or she has more
variations of slicing people up, than everyone expected. Who knows, maybe
mertian (Unknowingly) works for the Lady...
</p><p align=left>
<i>Sixth Section</i><br>
  Don't ask me why, I just had to write it.
</p><p align=left>
<i>Other Notes</i><br>
  Ithra Stargazer is an offstage character, whom I only mention as part of
the background. She is the leader of an almost legendary mercenary comapny,
knowing to combine swords'n'sorcery and psionics with maximum efficiency.
</p><p align=left>
  Just a piece of unrelated background you don't really need, but I thought
I mention it before someone asks.
</p><p align=left>
p.s.: Bimb's a decent leader, but she knows she has to be careful, so that
her emotions don't get the better of her, which is more of a risk than
might be obvious at the first glance...

I apologise for evading the topic of the Dabus Warrens, but I had the
feeling that there were things I should have known about the topic. Were
there? Is there really such a thing, or did someone just make it up?
</p><p align=left>
The timeframe I was unsure of apart from the first section (of three). I
thought it would be necessary to have the characters move a little quicker
than one would expect to parallel the activity in Sigil. Perhaps our
esteemed scribe can assign a time to the last two sections and scatter them
amongst other entries, if he sees fit. Suggestions are welcome.
</p><p align=left>
The two sections, in Limbo, didn't say too much past spinning the yarn.
Perhaps the major character development concerned Cray, who, by besting the
green slaad, showed his hand as a blood. This is fairly justifiable
considering the extent of his travels, and although his victory may have
been presently a little too offhandedly. Oh well.
</p><p align=left>
Harpsichord is (hopefully) developed throughout not just as the 'comic
relief' character, but also one who will speak her mind while others brood.
</p><p align=left>
The final, Yggdrasil scene offers somewhat more in terms of the mysterious
Delva issue. The reference to spiders is intended not just to relate to
Mertian, but also the demise of Shekelor - see the cryptic reference on
p.39 of the Planes of Chaos Travelogue. As I envision it, 'Delva' was a key
ally of Shekelor's, perhaps his lover, when he was defeated by Mertian. Of
course, one of you smarmy so-and-sos will probably prove me dead wrong ;)
</p><p align=left>
I wanted to continue, but thought it was a little unfair to hog that group
too much. However, if anyone cares to hear my opinion, I think an encounter
with the Queen of Air and Darkness (p.100 Book of Chaos) would be a gem.
She could certainly be an alien creature, perhaps as alien as the
mysterious Big Bad Thing from Niceguy's off the map planes. She may well be
able to provide access to forbidden Agathion. Furthermore, the dramatic
opportunities as Cray pits his weathered psyche, supported by Bliss'
talents, against the crushing weight of the Queen ... it's a winner for
sure !!!
</p><p align=left>
Think about it ;)

Alright, here's my segment.  Mertian's at the center of it (again -
alright, I admit, I kind of like him.  He seems almost like a
Gandalf/Merlin kind of character).  The adventurers on the planes have a
seemingly harmless encounter, but I believe there should be more to it. 
</p><p align=left>
Well, to start it off, I thought it seemed pretty strange that Mertian
would be making all these earth (plane?)-shattering decisions by himself,
so I decided the other aurumachs should probably have some say in what's
going on.  You might have guessed that the One is meant to be Center-of-All
(the rumors about the ultra-powerful aurumach), but I don't think what I've
written so far is even close to substantial, and is pretty easy to reverse.
 As for the supposed attack, I think it should be mainly delay purposes.
Maybe the Enemy needs some time to do something, so it's delaying the
adventurers' entry into Pandemonium.  There's some room to get creative (I
think).

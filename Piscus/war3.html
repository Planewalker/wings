Day Three, Dawn<br>
Near The Shattered Temple,  Sigil<br>
**[by B.Mooney]**
</p><p align=left>
Morning's first light found the foursome of Sabrilla, Kerjal, G'Kar, and Stefan picking their way through the 
rubble near the Athar headquarters.  The rains had given way to a thick fog that made the cityscape of abandoned 
buildings and jagged ruins seem a graveyard in most respects.  The area held onto memories of destruction at the 
hands of the Lady hundreds of years ago:  structures remained toppled, constructions smashed and brought low.  
Dabus crews had never moved in to clean up, perhaps at the order of their Mistress.  Only the most entrepreneuring 
(or addle-coved) Cagers set up shop here. Those and the Athar, of course.
</p><p align=left>
Sabrilla walked alongside her companions, her mind reflecting on the recent turn of events.  It was 
difficult to grasp how much had changed so quickly. Sigil under an invasion? The Lady of Pain missing?  And 
here Sabrilla was, adopting the role of heroine and trying to save the city.  She preferred to think of it as 
protecting her investment, her way of life.  She had taken great steps to move to Sigil, and endured much to 
get where she was now.  How could anyone in her position let it slip away that easily?
</p><p align=left>
And then there was the matter of Cray and Cantha,  the only two people she knew that could make her let down 
her guard.  Fate and circumstance had conspired to bring two old acquaintences back into her life. There were 
leagues of difference between those two, yet she cared deeply for them both.  Cantha was so full of life, always 
playful and flirtatious.  And yet she was very fickle at times, disappearing for days on end.  Cray on the other 
hand could be very caring, always knowing the right thing to say to her. It was just that he could be so moody at 
times, and understandably so.  He was haunted by the fact that one day he would slip into madness, perhaps 
returning to his violent past or worse. Their generosity was the common trait which seemed to attract her the 
most. When this ordeal was over, perhaps she could find time to spend with both and help repay her debts.
</p><p align=left>
The group continued on, the silence occasionally broken by the banter of G'kar and Kerjal. She imagined that 
their history ran deep, given the ease with which they carried on.  Stefan was a direct contrast to the pair, 
silent and constantly watching about.  Throughout their travels, his sword was either free of its scabbard or 
his hand rested firmly on its hilt.  She regarded him closely. Before today, no one suspected that these brain 
collector creatures were involved.  It seemed that no one even knew what they were. But Stefan, a Prime of all 
things, had encountered and actually fought one before.  Was his wariness due to dangers of these Neh-thalggu, 
or was it something else?
</p><p align=left>
A large structure appeared through the mists as they pressed forwards. In its early days, before the fall of 
Aoskar, the building was called the Great Temple of Doors.  Now it served as a testament to his downfall, a 
base of operations fitting to the faction sometimes called the Godless.  The Athar had not taken great pains 
to repair the building, instead allowing its presence to dissuade unwanted visitors.  The ploy seemed effective, 
for at this time of morning, no one was approaching the Shattered Temple save for them.  Drawing closer, they 
could see armored guards standing watch outside of the main gates.
</p><p align=left>
"Have we decided on the best way to reach the Factol?"  G'kar asked, directing his question to Sabrilla.  
She shrugged her shoulders and cast a glance at the rest of the group. 
</p><p align=left>
"Not really.  I'm guessing that using force to bash our way in is out of the question."  She studied the 
guards ahead of them.  There were two sturdy men stationed outside, each wearing a breastplate colored grey 
and green.  A lengthy polearm stood upright in one hand and a sheathed sword hung from the belt.  "So that 
leaves talking to them."
</p><p align=left>
"How receptive are the Athar at letting visitors in?" G'Kar asked.
</p><p align=left>
Kerjal was the first to reply. " I believe they used to hold tours or something, but I think that 
stopped a few years ago.  It probably depends on what your purpose is."
</p><p align=left>
Sabrilla smirked. "Well, you see, we're here to save your Factol's life from these brain collector 
things that come from another dimension. The halfling was right - it does sound like a bunch of screed."  
</p><p align=left>
"Perhaps," Kerjal pondered as they neared the front, "but maybe the direct approach is best."  Sabrilla 
turned to regard the tiefling.  She wanted to ask what his plan was, but by then they were within earshot of the guards.
</p><p align=left>
"Hold," one of the guardsmen said, tilting his poleaxe forwards. "What is your purpose at the Temple?"  
The group looked at each other, and Kerjal stepped forwards.
</p><p align=left>
"Sirs, we have need to enter your abode and speak with someone-"  The other guard cut him off with a gruff voice.
</p><p align=left>
"None of the portals work, not even the one to the Astral . So there's no need to waste your time."  
Unabashed, Kerjal smiled and continued.
</p><p align=left>
"Actually, we're not looking to find an escape route. We have important business that we need to discuss 
with Factol Terrance."  The guards looked at each other, smiling from some private joke.  The mage's smile 
dropped, guessing their answer.
</p><p align=left>
"Sorry," the surly guard continued, "but he's not taking any visitors right now. Come back later." He 
gave a venomous grin and resumed his post, ignoring the visitors' presence. 
</p><p align=left>
"Please. It's very important. The Factol's in danger-"
</p><p align=left>
"Get out of here before I carve you another bone-box!"  The guard stepped forward menacingly, his weapon 
tilted towards Kerjal.  Everyone tensed up except G'Kar. He reached and placed his hand on Kerjal's shoulder. 
</p><p align=left>
"It's okay. Let's get out of here."  His three companions hesitated, waiting for the first move. Then, one 
by one they turned and headed away from the Shattered Temple. None of them appeared happy. They could hear the 
guards conversing as they began to leave.
</p><p align=left>
"Maybe we could garnish them a bit." G'Kar said.
</p><p align=left>
Stefan's face had reddened, his hand clutched tight around the hilt of his weapon. "Are you sure force is 
out of the question?" 
</p><p align=left>
"That Temple could use some statues." added the medusa.
</p><p align=left>
"One down, how many to go?" asked Kerjal.
</p><p align=left>
A loud voice called out to them from the Temple. "Wait a minute, cutters."
</p><p align=left>
They each turned around, prepared for additional abuse by the two guardsmen. To their surprise, the voice 
came from a third indivdual who was standing out in front of the guards. He looked to be a man in his forties 
with short black hair and a neatly trimmed beard. Instead of polished armor with faction colors, he wore simple 
leather breeches and a grey jacket. Faction insignias adorned the shoulders.
</p><p align=left>
"You say the Factol is in danger. What sort of danger?"  He arched his eyebrows and awaited a response.  
Sabrilla could tell by his easy demeanor and the silence of the guards that he carried some weight within the 
faction. She answered his question.
</p><p align=left>
"There's going to be an attempt on his life, as well as the other factols."
</p><p align=left>
"By whom?"
</p><p align=left>
"The same forces that closed down the portals."  He pondered this for a moment, stroking his goatee.  She 
could tell she had his attention now. 
</p><p align=left>
"And I suppose you know who these 'forces' are..."
</p><p align=left>
"We do, but that's for the Factol. Not some errand-boy."
</p><p align=left>
The two guards tensed up at this apparent insult. The man in grey gave a wicked laugh. It seemed that he 
liked to play these power games. "The name is Wilhelm, actually. Well, if you've got the chant, I'll make sure 
you talk to the man."  He turned and motioned to the main doors. The four looked to each other and started into 
the building. "Oh, and you're a little late. There was an attack on all the factols last night at the Twelve 
Factols Inn.  They made it out without any problems, though."
</p><p align=left>
"Yeah, that's the problem with some killers.  They keep trying until they get it right."

Day Three, Just past dawn<br>
The Para-elemental Plane of Ooze, Inner Planes<br>
**[by Branno]**
</p><p align=left>
"By the swift breath o' Hermes!"  Harpsichord's exclamation was mirrored
in strength, if not in form of every member of the small, strange band
from Sigil.  All about them slurped and slugged a dark thick morass of
slime and ooze.  The stuff barely contained any physical consistency,
moving with sickening sliding motions from one point in space to the
next.  It made a body feel seasick (or perhaps sludge-sick) merely
looking at it.  It was all a uniform, dark, hard-to-categorize color,
for as it moved, it seemed to have the slightest rippling of color
within it.  The ooze tricked the eye as surely as it would trick the
hand if one held it.
</p><p align=left>
Bliss walked tentatively to the edge of the transparent bubble of
magical force that held the sickening stuff at bay.  Extending a mauve
colored hand, he tapped the bubble once, causing it to ring with a
resonating sound much like that of a bell.  Curling a tentacle in
seeming satisfaction, the mind-friar looked to Delva with its
milky-white eyes.  * How long will it last? *, he projected to her, a
slight bit of nervousness slipped through his formidable mental shield;
it was apparent that he did not want to feel the embrace of what lay
without.
</p><p align=left>
The strange woman that he had only met two nights hence looked up at him
with the same vacant look in her eyes.  She was much paler now, despite
the well-rested night at the Feast & Famine, with dark circles under her
eyes and a green cast to her skin.  "The sphere should last for a time
sufficient enough to get us out of this slop-hole, but no more than a
day.  It will provide us with the light that exists now, and enough air
to breathe.  I can control the temperature somewhat, so if ye get cold
or hot, let a lady know."  Delva paused for a moment, a look of intense
concentration passing over her jarring features.  Something apparently
won out, for her usual half-blank look returned, and she continued, as
if she had never ceased.  "Also, we will be protected from the
hostilities of the ooze about us, but if we are attacked by creatures
native to the plane, it may or may not protect ya."
</p><p align=left>
Bliss nodded once, but kept his thoughts to himself for the moment.  The
mental vibrations coming from Delva were unlike any that he had ever
seen before.  He was no longer certain if they could be attributed to
the simple answer of insanity, as he had first suspected.  He made a
mental note to speak with Cray in private about this.  <I>'As soon as we
have dry ground beneath our feet again, that is...'</I>, he thought.
The mind-friar looked to the center of the sphere where the tiefling
sat, eyes closed and in lotus-style, a grin that only a Bleaker could
wear without being committed plastered upon his features.
</p><p align=left>
"Aahhh, I don't mean ta be breakin' up th' tea party an' all, but if
Miss Delva 'ere says 'at less 'n a day's all we've got, then less
bone-box rattlin' and more movin' I think is order!"  The priestess of
Hermes shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot, as if she expected the
invisible floor to give way at any moment.  "I'm not to randy with this
'ere sphere.  I need stones beneath my bones, as sure as Sigil!"
</p><p align=left>
Bliss again found himself wondering how this priestess managed to keep
her mental state stable.  In addition to her kleptomania, she also
harbored an irrational fear of being in tight, cramped areas.  While
this claustrophobia was not as progressed as the other was, Bliss saw
that, if this cerebral fault line was subjected to a great deal of
stress, the poor woman would topple like the Shattered Temple.
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, Cray, just how do we expect to find a portal to Limbo in all of
this mess?" Delva screeched the tone in her voice indicating that she
already knew that the venture was doomed to failure.  She gestured
wildly with a talon-like hand towards the slippery, ever sliding and
burping world around them.
</p><p align=left>
Cray, without opening his eyes, merely widened his grin a bit, and
replied, "Why, ask, of course..."
</p>

Day Three, Just past dawn<br>
Approaching the Mortuary, the Hive Ward, Sigil<br>
**[by Branno]**
</P><p align=left>
"I can't believe that sod!  What kind of kip doesn't include breakfast
in the price of a room!  I've traveled half the known Planes and never
once have I heard such!  I bet that biter slid me that screed just
because I'm a halfling!"  Tandin ceased his grumbling for a moment to
walk around a large, sooty-water filled puddle.  Although the
extraordinarily tough soles of his feet provided him with more
protection than most cutter's boots, they did very little to keep out
the cold and the wet.  There were a few things that Tandin hated more
than having wet, cold feet, but not many.  One of those things, however,
just happened to be not getting breakfast.
</p><p align=left>
Just as the halfling was beginning a triad on how breakfast was the
'single most important meal of the day'; a slight ruffle of feathers
from behind and the tensed stance of the dust mephit caused Tandin
pause.  Looking up, he saw something that he hated worse than wet feet
and mixed breakfasts put together - tanar'ri bashers.
</p><p align=left>
Two tiefers stood at the fore, mercenaries by the look - mismatched
leather and chain armor, weapons that looked like they belonged in other
basher's hands.  One was green and scaly with slightly bulging eyes; the
other was pale-skinned with long, slender fingers and darting, quick
eyes.  Behind them were their 'charges', half a dozen dretches - long
armed, bloated, sad-faced little biters that were the brainless fodder
of the massive tanar'ri warforces, and four rutterkin - the malformed
bastard tanar'ri sons of the Blood War.  The last wielded wicked-looking
weapons, double-crescent-headed polearms and saw-toothed broad swords.
</p><p align=left>
"Uriel - Stay!" barked Durthelaxus to the deva at his side.  Tandin had
not been around the dust mephit for long, but he knew that by the look
in his eye that he was worried.  No doubt that the deva was ready to
pounce on these bubbers, but with all of the reported fiend activity in
the city, especially the Hive Ward, any confrontation would bring half
of the army down upon their heads.  They could probably take out these
biters with little blood loss, especially with Uriel at their side, but
half a battalion?
</p><p align=left>
The one with the pale skin, <I>'Shifty'</I>, Tandin called him in his
mind, spoke first.  His words came out like a buttered snake, slipping
past his lips almost with a life of their own.  "Ssso, what have we
here?"  The rutterkin shifted slightly at his words, as if they were
expecting something else to come out, but they held their ground.
Shifty didn't pay them any heed.  "Quite an unusual group of bashersss
we have here, yessss?"
</p><p align=left>
The other one croaked a husky, one-syllable laugh from somewhere
deep within his throat.  <I>'Yep, that settles it'</I>, Tandin thought.
<I>'Frog.'</I>
</p><p align=left>
Durthelaxus spoke up quickly; his usual bravado was peculiarly absent.
"Just some sods, headin' out o' this dump.  We heard that Sigil was the
place to be, but this burg has tipped barmy."
</p><p align=left>
Shifty looked from the tiny mephit to the deva and then back again.  He
made a sound much like that of a snake's scales over dry leaves that
seemed to come from his nose, and then held out his long-fingered palm.
"Well, if blowin' thisss burg isss in yer plansss, then yer gonna hafta
get by usss firssst, yesss?"
</p><p align=left>
Tandin shifted his feet in the mud, getting ready for the onset of their
charge; one hand was already on the pommel of his favorite throwing
dirk.  The way he figured it, if Shifty went down, half of his
'appropriated' troops would scatter like Arborean wind blossoms.
</p><p align=left>
"Pay the man, Tandin!" Durthelaxus barked, using the same tone that he
had earlier with the deva.
</p><p align=left>
Tandin, thunderstruck, nearly fell on his rear in the sooty street.  The
look from the mephit was one of a body staring down a canoloth.  It
said, 'if you don't do something right now, <B>I</B> will be signing my
own name into the dead-book'.  Tandin shook his head slightly and fished
out a pouch containing the vast majority of his earthly riches.  He
tossed it over to Shifty.
</p><p align=left>
"Thank you for your generousss patronage, berks!"  Shifty stepped aside
as he began laughing.  His bashers, mirroring his movements, did the
same.
</p><p align=left>
The three companions passed through unmolested.
</p><p align=left>
After a few blocks and no ambushes erupted from the alleys around them,
Tandin grumbled.  "See.  I <B>told</B> you would should have had
breakfast!"
</p>
<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center>

<p align=left>
Day Three, Just Past Dawn<br>
The Lower Ward, Sigil<br>
**[by Daniel Reddy]**
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis walked down the crowded street, nudging aside anything that
happened to be in his way.  The last two days have, on the whole, been very
bad for the orcish captain.  Three mornings ago he was to have met with
Arglander from Thuldanin at the Hammered Fist. The original message he
received stated it was of paramount importance that he be there for
Arglander's instructions, and so he and his lieutenant, Nargot, had found
the nearest portal to Sigil from the Outlands, went to the tavern and
waited.  And waited.  The Hammered Fist was not his first choice for a place
to receive an important message, but it contained the most reliable portal
to Acheron, so he had little choice but to enter the tavern and put up with
the medusa that ran it.
</p><p align=left>
Nargot snorted. "This is a fine mess.  I hate being stuck with all of these
sods in this dirty city."
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis turned to his lieutenant. "Quit your complaining, rat filth. All
you've done for the last two days is complain and I'm sick of it!"
</p><p align=left>
Nargot leered back. "Yeah? And all you've done is kept your bone-box shut
and strutted around stewing like some spoiled elvish brat!  And where has
that gotten us? No where!"
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis turned and punched Nargot in the snout. "I am in command here,
berk! Never forget that! Why are we in this mess? Why? Because I have fools
like you constantly interrupting my thoughts on how to get us out of this
mess!" Braktuis kicked Nargot.  "Now shut up and obey! Unless you want to
take a shot being the leader..."
</p><p align=left>
Nargot looked at Braktuis and then backed down. "We both know that you are
the better swordsman. I will not invoke the Right of Challenge. I die at
your command."
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis snorted. "That is better."
</p><p align=left>
Nargot looked at his commander. "Ever since we got here, things have been
bad. Starting with the Deva walking in on us."
</p><p align=left>
He snarled at the memory. He should have known it was going to be a bad day
when the Dust Mephit and its pet Deva entered the establishment.  No, he
should have known it was going to be a bad day when he saw the statue of the
Dabus next to the portal. And it was a bad day indeed.  Something was wrong
with the portal.  Arglander did make it through the defective door - with
his head half bitten off.  Braktuis shuddered.  Of all the ways to die...
</p><p align=left>
Suddenly a loud commotion was heard from an alleyway thirty yards in front
of him.  A large cloud of dust billowed forth from the alley and everyone in
the street backed away, those closest to the alley began screaming and
suddenly tanar'ri began to pour forth.  The crowd turned into a mob as
everyone collectively began to scatter, trying to get away from the fiends.
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis' sword was drawn in an instant, and he used it on the closest sods
that were beginning to press against him.  Nargot grasped his shoulder and
pointed. "The landing - we can escape over the building."  Braktuis turned
and looked at the balcony situated over a merchant's cart.  A stairway rose
upwards to the left from it to the roof of the building. "Right. Go!"  He
and Nargot began to wind through the crowd to the cart.  Once there he
hoisted Nargot on to it.  Nargot then pulled him up and then hoisted him to
the balcony.  Braktuis reached down to pull Nargot up just as the cart
exploded into splinters and dust.
</p><p align=left>
"Nargot!"
</p><p align=left>
As the dust cleared, he could see Nargot sitting on the ground, dazed and
burned.  And then the throng began to trample him.
</p><p align=left>
"Nargot!" Braktuis howled again.
</p><p align=left>
Suddenly his vision went black.  He heard a buzzing noise coming from his
left, and suddenly his warrior instinct took over.  He dropped flat on his
back while swinging his sword upward, striking something.  The drone went
past him and he was instantly on his feet and racing to where he remembered
the stairway to have been.  He tripped over something and was suddenly in
light, as he fell on to the rising stairs.  He was on his feet again and
climbing the stairs when he saw a flying mosquito-like fiend circle back
towards him. A Chasme. The fiend's eyes glowered red at him and he saw a
cracked portion of its exoskeleton where his sword had drawn first blood.
The Chasme began its charge from above, trying to force Braktuis back into
the darkness.  It dove upon him as he tried to duck, its pointed beak
narrowly missing his head. Its lower abdomen suddenly swung down and knocked
Braktuis backward into the darkness. Braktuis landed on his back, and
instantly rolled to his right until he struck the wall.  Immediately there
was a loud crash as the Chasme landed on the balcony right where he was
before.  Braktuis swung his sword down upon the area he thought the Chasme
to be, striking something solid. He felt his blow sever whatever he struck
and continue to the floor of the balcony. The Chasme suddenly stopped moving
and tipped over the outer edge.
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis took a deep breath and then rushed up the stairway again. As he
gained the roof, he turned and looked down upon the street. The tanar'ri
were taking captives and dragging them back into the alleyway.
</p><p align=left>
Braktuis growled. "I hate fiends. This is definitely going to be another bad
day."
</p><p align=left>
He turned and ran the opposite direction across the flat roof.

Day three, Morning<br>
Paraelemental Plane of Ooze, Inner Planes<br>
**[by Ian Watson]**
</p><p align=left>
The look on Bliss' face made it evident he was wondering if Cray
shouldn't be in the Gatehouse after all.
</p><p align=left>
*Ask?  How, pray tell, do we ask something anything in this mess?  And who?*
</p><p align=left>
"Now, now, Bliss.  I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.  In any case,
it shouldn't take too long.  If you'd kindly head in that direction, Delva?"
The Bleaker resumed his apparent meditation in the centre of the bubble.
</p><p align=left>
None of the others looked particularly pleased at having to stay here
any longer than was necessary.  Harpsichord looked about ready to throw up.
No surprise, when one could plainly see the worms and maggots that infested
the plane constantly hitting the leading edge of the bubble, apparently
trying to find a way in.  Some of them must have been as long as
Harpsichord's staff.  What a repulsive plane!  Even Delva seemed affected,
squinting her eyes shut against her surroundings.  Her back even spasmed
once or twice in disgust.  Poor thing.
</p><p align=left>
After an hour or two, even Bliss seemed affected.  Cray shifted his
weight, having finished his message some time ago.  He was about to assure
everyone that it wouldn't be very much longer when Harpsichord shrieked.
Her eyes had gone wide, and she looked about ready to be committed to the
Gatehouse herself.  Cray turned to see what she was staring at, and his eyes
came to rest next to him, where apparently some ooze had started to invade
the bubble.
</p><p align=left>
"It's okay, Harpsichord!  This is the... ahem... person I was looking
for.  I hope so, at least."  He turned to the puddle of ooze.  "Purguliss,
is that you?  I've been told to seek you out, that you could show us a
portal to the plane of Limbo."
</p><p align=left>
To everyone's surprise, the puddle extended some sort of pseudopod and
nodded as if saying yes.  Cray gave a mental sigh; he had to make his
friends think he knew what he was doing.
</p><p align=left>
The pseudopod pointed in a direction perpendicular to direction they had
been headed in, and formed a large majestic hand, fit to be owned by the
greatest sculpture.  But while everyone else looked at the hand, the side
closest to Cray formed a small mouth and smirked.  Of course, thought Cray.
Ooze sprites could read minds.
</p><p align=left>
The bubble headed off in the direction pointed at, and a short time
later, a circular area could be seen beyond the ooze.  It was bright and
multi-coloured, from what they could see.  It must be the portal to Limbo.
Cray looked down to thank Purguliss, but he was already gone.  Then he
looked up to Delva.
</p><p align=left>
"I don't suppose this bubble of yours will function in Limbo, will it?"
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p align=left>
Day Three, Morning<br>
Unnamed alley near Shattered Temple, Sigil<br>
**[by Ian Watson]**
</p><p align=left>
Strontian stood in the shadows, wrapping them around him.  The guard at
the Shattered Temple had just changed, and one of the guards at this time
always came this way.  A shortcut home, perhaps.  It mattered little, of
course.  Nothing must get in the way of the goal.
</p><p align=left>
The guard tromped through the alley, expecting any knights of the
cross-trade to leave him be.  And perhaps, with his bulk, an ordinary thief
would have.  But Strontian was hardly a thief, and hardly ordinary.  As the
guard approached his shadow, he struck.  He leaped out, catching the guard
off-guard.  Strontian laughed at this bit of irony in such a serious
situation.  He wrapped a snake completely around the neck of the guard.
</p><p align=left>
The man's eyes briefly bulged in intense pain before he collapsed in a
heap on the ground.  The One in the Shadows smiled and watched with almost
childlike glee as the snake sank into the guard's neck, in the form of a
snake biting it's own tail, much like the one currently working it's way
into the Shattered Mage's soul.  She would be ready soon.  But not too soon.
Mustn't rush things.  This snake, however, because of it's placement and
design, worked immediately.  The guard stood up, with a look on his face
embodying both submissiveness and malice, somehow.  He brushed himself off,
nodded to Strontian, and walked purposefully back to the Shattered Temple.
The temple where that medusa and her companions were just now meeting the
Factol, if Strontian's new intelligence was correct.  His old intelligence
had been disposed of after the incident at the Twelve Factols.
</p><p align=left>
He watched the guard get waved through into the building.  Strontian
smiled a third time before running out of the alley to further his plan.  He
ran, but not too quickly.  Mustn't rush things, after all.

Day 3, Morning<br>
Somewhere Beneath Sigil<br>
**[by Ken Lipka]**
</p><p align=left>
Nick Tanner stepped out from his little shop and snatched a quick breath from the smoke-filled skies of Sigil.  The smoke smelled odd, scenting more of flesh than rust or metal.  He supposed the winds must be blowing in from over the Mortuary this day.  But, the Dustmen didn't burn the dead normally.  Shrugging off the unease he felt, he pulled the tarps off his shop to shake the cinders and soot off them, and proceeded to make his little leather tanning stall ready for the day's custom.  Nick then picked up a push broom, and began to sweep the piles of bodies towards the Limbo portal.
</p><p align=left>
Mort, the shopkeeper across the way, came out of his shop.  He didn't look too good.  It was probably the large sword gash across his chest that left his rib and organs exposed that made Mort look ill.   The other man held up two handfuls of severed chicken heads and feathers and called out,  "Thanks for taking care of my chickens while I was gone, Nick."  Nick smiled and waved, he knew Mort would understand.  The tanner finished sweeping the bodies into the portal and then returned to his shop.
</p><p align=left>
Nick was starting to get the feeling that something was very wrong in Sigil today.  Surely Mort should be in bed with a nasty wound like that.  And it wasn't like the Dustmen to let bodies lie in the street like this.  Suddenly, he became aware of a presence behind him.  Turning around, Nick came face to face with a grinning horror and a flaming scimitar came swinging down upon his neck...
</p><p align=left>
Nick Tanner sat bolt upright, awaking from his nightmare with a cold sweat and a heart-felt scream.  He sat very still, feeling his heart pound in his chest and listen to the echoes of his cry slowly dying in the darkened chamber in which he was trapped.  It would take many minutes before he was calm enough to try and go about getting a start to his day.  He couldn't help but spend a few morbid moments trying to decide which was a worse place to be - the Sigil of his nightmare, or this deserted death chamber.
</p><p align=left>
He had arrived here yesterday, although how many hours it had been he did not know.  It was right after he had tried to pick up that glowing crystal in the alley near his home.  Nick cursed himself yet again when he thought of that object.  He had known it was magical when he saw it - mundane things don't glow.  He had known it was magical when he held it in his tongs - mundane things don't make you get cold.  But he was so desperate to try and find something to get in good with the block high-up so he could get some more food; he just refused to listen to his common sense and gone and touched the thing with his bare hands.  "Serves you right, Nick Tanner.  Maybe, if you live through this, you'll learn to mind your own business."
</p><p align=left>
He sighed, and began cleaning up his makeshift bed.  He had curled up in a corner of the dark and dusty chamber and placed his lucky ever-burning candles in a semi-circle in front of him.  Harm had never come to him while he slept with them lit; thankfully, last night was no exception.  Still, he hadn't trusted entirely to luck.  Nick had also placed some of his dabus-cards in front of candles in case anyone - or anything - had happened by while he slept.  He had spelled out "Don't hurt me.  I'm lost."  Trusting to the kindness of strangers was a very Clueless thing to do in Sigil, but Nick was sure that most beings don't waste energy killing harmless beings.  And Nick was certain he looked as harmless as they come.  Nick extinguished all but one of the candles, putting the rest into his backpack.  He picked up his cards and blanket and stored those as well.  Finally, he pulled out some of the chicken jerky and began to eat breakfast.  Once he'd taken the edge off of his hunger, he picked up the last candle and began, once more, to explore the chamber.
</p><p align=left>
It all seemed terribly futile, but he had to try.  He followed his own footsteps, still visible in the thick dust which coated the floor of the chamber.  Nick had traced this route nearly a dozen times yesterday, but he hoped he was rested enough after his sleep that he might find something he had missed in his earlier searches.  The room was seemingly carved from a gray stone which looked much like the cobblestones of Sigil's streets.  The walls were seamless and lacked anything that could possibly be, or mark the presence of a door.  The ceiling was a dome, high overhead, which served to make the tanner's footsteps echo that much louder and longer.  The chamber itself held row upon row of stone boxes which appear to be part of the floor - as if when the room was made, the floor was carved to a lower level, leaving the containers behind.  Nick tried to think of the things as boxes, or crates, and the room as a warehouse, in the hope it would keep him calm.  But he couldn't maintain the illusion for long.  He knew for a fact that the boxes were coffins, and that the room was a tomb.  He also knew that this tomb was for the dabus of Sigil.  That fact he gleaned from the symbols which floated over each coffin.  He couldn't read them as they were not the type of words he normally saw the Ladies-in-Waiting use.  But, from the way they floated in space over the boxes, they had to be dabus-speak.  In fact, Nick was fairly sure that the symbols were names.
</p><p align=left>
The fact that he was in a room full of dead dabus, while unnerving to say the least - he hadn't thought that the dabus <u>could</u> die - was also morbidly reassuring.  It showed that wherever he was, it was still in Sigil.  And, given that he was in Sigil, he could only be in one of two places.  Either he was somewhere within the Mortuary, as all of Sigil's dead go there, or else he was under the Cage's streets, in the rumored and legendary Dabus Warrens.  Neither option seemed to be a good one, but Nick hoped it was the first.  That way, he'd at least know where he was and how to get home, provided he ever got out of this chamber.
</p><p align=left>
After some time, Nick sat down on the floor and leaned against the wall.  He had poked and pounded on all the walls and stomped on every inch of the floor.  All of it was solid and unyielding.  There were no doors into this place.  He knew that now.  "Just like the dabus," he muttered to himself.  "Building a room with no doors.  No consideration for others.  Just 'cause they know all the portals and can blip into any part of the city so's you don't see them coming..."  He trailed off as he just realized the importance of what he'd said.  He was still trying to think like a person when he was faced with a whole room of proof that he was where only the dabus set foot, so to speak.  Nick had to start thinking like a dabus if he was to ever get home again.  The dabus worked for the Lady, and the Lady controlled Sigil.  And Sigil was the biggest collection of portals in the multiverse.  He mentally hit himself.  He had wasted a lot of time looking for a regular door, when he should have been looking for one of the Lady's.
</p><p align=left>
Nick quickly scrambled to his feet, and quickly began to look for any kind of an arch or other bounded space.  Now that he knew what to look for, he quickly found it.  There were three of them in the room.  A thin arch of stone connecting a pair of the tombs.  He'd missed them before because all was the same gray and so the arches were nearly invisible to normal sight unless you were looking for them.  Nick concentrated at each one, using the time-honored ability of planar creatures to look <u>through</u> things to see the telltale auras of portals.  All three arches held the glow.  He heaved a great sigh of relief, he'd found his way out.  Sure, he didn't know the keys, know where they went, or even if they still worked.
</p><p align=left>
But now, Nick Tanner had something he hadn't had for a while - hope.

Day 3, Morning<br>
The Mortuary, Sigil<br>
**[by Ken Lipka]**
</p><p align=left>
Pathosis awoke with a small start, blinking rapidly trying to determine exactly where he was.  Once his eyes focused, the Dustman found that he had been asleep at his work table.  Many pages of notes lay scattered across its surface, fighting for space with the recently filled sample jars.  The quill he had been using to make his rough notes before dictating them to 187 lay on the floor where it had fallen from his hands.  Rubbing his eyes with a groan, Pathosis called out for his assistant.
</p><p align=left>
"187?  Are you here?"
</p><p align=left>
A click and whir announced the presence of the rogue modron even before it answered his question.  "Yes.  What do you require?"
</p><p align=left>
"How long have I been asleep?  Where were we in the dissection process?"
</p><p align=left>
"It has been approximately six and three-quarter hours since you unexpectedly entered the rest state.  At that time, you were beginning to try and classify the functions of the three auxiliary brains of the test subject."
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, I remember.  Thank you, 187."  Pathosis stood and stretched his sore muscles; the pain proved that he had not slipped closer to the True Death while he slept.  A pity, he reasoned.  Moving to the wash basin, he splashed some water on his face and began mentally reviewing all of the discoveries he'd made the previous night.  The first had been the obvious shock of discovering the "little crab's" true appearance under the armor.  Beyond that, once he'd started his dissection, the mysteries continued to appear.
</p><p align=left>
He started with a routine internal examination, to find the general layout of the skeletal structure and organs.  The first discovery was that the creature had no skeleton to speak of; merely a dense collection of muscle fibers and other tissues.  It was a logical finding, upon reflection.  After all, the creature had been able to compress its immense bulk into the suit of armor.  Upon examining the creature's mouth, Pathosis had found more evidence to support his pet theory that this was some distant cousin of the Illithids.  Inside, beyond the impressive rows of teeth, he had found a quartet of small tentacles.  Initially, the Dustman was confused as to their purpose, but later findings provided a chillingly clear picture of their intended function.  It seemed that the corpse had two digestive systems.  One was fairly normal:  a throat, a stomach, intestines and the like.  It was the second one that truly gave Pathosis chills.
</p><p align=left>
The second system, rather than going to another stomach as with a minotaur, ran instead directly into the head.  There, Pathosis found a series of twelve interconnected cavities within the creature's own immense brain.  And inside those cavities, the Dustman found the critical piece of the puzzle to the corpses that he and 187 had been receiving.  In three of the cavities he found a humanoid brain; all of which now rested in the sample jars on the table before him.  It seemed that, unlike the Illithids, these creatures did not exactly feed on brains.  Instead, for unknown reasons, removed and stored brains within their own.  Based on the fluids he found inside the storage cavities, it would seem that these "collected" brains were being kept alive - or at least, preserved.  And that was the truly frightening thought.  If these "brain collectors" were somehow able to add a being's brain to their own, and keep it alive, they could quite possibly have access to that brain's knowledge and memories.  Who knows what that might mean for psionic or magical abilities?  Those possibilities, along with the unknown number of the creatures in Sigil, made for a very bad situation.
</p><p align=left>
"Well, 187.  What information do we have on the subject at hand?"
</p><p align=left>
The rogue modron thought for a moment, and then began to recite the pair's findings from the past day.
</p><p align=left>
"The creature is unknown - there are no records of such beings in the Mortuary's archives.  It is capable of removing the cranium of beings and taking the brain into it's own for storage and unknown uses.  This can be done up to twelve times.  Based on the number of corpses obviously attributable to the creature's dental imprint, there are at least four other creatures somewhere in the Lower Ward.  An unknown number of the creatures also exist in the mazes which now take the place of the destinations of the city's portals.  The appearance of these creatures is somehow linked to the failure of the portals.  We also know that at least one other party knows at least as much about the creatures as we do.  This is evidenced by the metallic shrapnel found to be the cause of death."
</p><p align=left>
Pathosis nodded.  "Yes.  It seems that some one managed to booby trap a brain.  However, there is also the possibility that it tried to take the brain of a bladeling.  What is it that we <I>don't</I> know about these creatures?"
</p><p align=left>
"We do not know their plane and realm of origin.  We do not know how they are linked to the failure of portals.  We do not know where in the Lower Ward the other creatures are located.  We do not know how the appearance of small armies of fiends relates to the creatures' presence in the mazes.  We do not know what the creatures want in Sigil, beyond the obvious desire for brains."
</p><p align=left>
"Indeed.  Being isolated in the Mortuary, it would seem that know all we can about the physical nature of the beasts, but are severely lacking insight into their mental motivations.  We need to get this information to some one, but who?"
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
"Tell me again who we're looking for,"  Druthelaxus demanded from his perch atop Uriel's head.  The dust mephit had long since grown tired of walking or flying, and so was quick to take advantage of the deva's complacency.
</p><p align=left>
Tandin sighed.  "Cantha told us to find some Dustie named Pathosis as he's apparently got one of those collector-things on a slab somewhere.  I suppose he's supposed to tell us what they look like so your buddy there can look sideways or whatever and find them."
</p><p align=left>
Druthelaxus puffed his chest out in indignation at the halfling's tone, but decided against saying anything more.  His actions dropped another layer of dust upon the deva's head and shoulders.  Uriel, of course, said nothing.  The odd trio had finally made it through the tanar'ri infested warrens of the Hive's streets and were approaching the Mortuary.  The streets here still held some activity; people with wagons and pushcarts were entering and leaving the gates to the Dustmen headquarters as fast as they were able.  All arrivals bore full loads of corpses.  A flicker of some emotion played across the passive deva's face while Tandin grimaced in disgust at the smell.  The urgency of their task was the only thing which made them grit their teeth and willingly enter the Mortuary.
</p><p align=left>
Inside, it was obvious that both the fiends and the failure of the portals were taking their toll on the Cage.  The bodies being brought in were being carefully stacked like cordwood along the walls of the chambers and halls of the vast building.  Many Dustmen were at work cataloging the bodies and their eventual plane of disposition.  The smell here was steadily growing worse than that of the courtyard given the closer quarters.  The trio waited for a few moments to see if anyone would notice them.  When it didn't happen, Tandin stepped out and tugged on the robe of the nearest Dead.  "Hey!  Care to take a break and help us out here?"
</p><p align=left>
The factioneer slowly turned to face the impatient halfling.  The man's dark eyes gazed over the group impassively from hollow and sunken cheeks.  Finally, he spoke in a low whisper.  "I see that you have not brought any of your former friends with you.  Have you come to seek the next stage along the Path to True Death?"
</p><p align=left>
Before Tandin could sputter a reply, Druthelaxus jumped into the conversation.  "While we all truly realize the utter tragedy that is Life, we're having too much fun to move along just yet.  In the meantime, you can tell us where to find one of your fellows - Pathosis."  The Dustman considered for a moment, then decided the mephit's attitude wasn't worth caring about and gave the trio precise directions on where to find Pathosis' work area.
</p><p align=left>
As the three moved along the body-lined halls of the Mortuary, Tandin glared angrily at the dust mephit and snapped, "Well, you've taken care of another political situation.  What in the whistles do you need me along for anyway?"
</p><p align=left>
"I don't have belt pouches full of jink.  Besides, I fully expect you to be able to get your bribe back once you've handed it over."
</p><p align=left>
The halfling wasn't sure how to take that comment, and was prevented from making a suitable retort by their arrival at the door to Pathosis' work room.  The mephit directed the deva to knock on the door.
</p><p align=left>
The door was quickly jerked open by a tall human with a leathery complexion.  He was muttering under his breath about "...sodding constant interruptions...  ...how can I ever get any work done around here..." and the like.  His muted tirade was cut off when he noticed a large deva standing in his doorway.  The Dustman nervously cleared his throat and asked, "Uh... may I help you?"
</p><p align=left>
Tandin jumped into the conversation before the pushy mephit.  "Are you Pathosis?"  Upon seeing the man nod, the halfling continued, pushing himself past the human and into the room.  "Good.  We've just come across the fiend-infested Hive in order to talk to you.  You've supposedly got a corpse we'd like to see.  Oh yes, you're also going to accompany us to find these things after we tell you what's up.  So, what do you say, old man?"
</p><p align=left>
Pathosis blinked several times before his mind could catch up with the speed of Tandin's words.  "I say, are you friends of Bliss?"  It was Tandin's turn to nod.  "Ah, I see now.  Excellent.  Yes, I do have a corpse and I do believe that I have a bit of information to add to yours..."

The Civic Festhall<br>
Morning, Day Three<br>
**[by Lars H. L&ouml;her]**
</p><p align=left>
Blades slicing through whirlpools of colour, dancing, whirling without aim,
lost and alone. Wavering ghostly bodies unaffected by cold steel. Some
scream in agony, other dance with joy, more stand motionless, faces lacking
of expressions, if they had faces at all. Some lacked limbs, heads and
other parts that should be vital to a mortal, but where a mere inconveniency for
a spectral being.
</p><p align=left>
Shadows fall over the assembled crowd, giving the whole an eerie quality.
As though several dozen ghosts weren't an eerie group in the first place,
but it seemed the axiom of nonexisting limits to any type of impression or
emotion was just proven to be true again. Just what, by the nine stinking
pits of depravity, was going on here, one of the many ghosts wondered. She
seemed whole and there wasn't anything obviously amiss about her, except for an -
even for a newly formed ghost - extremely distraught expression. Wondering
where she was the shadow closed on her and seemed to condense into a form
she was going to understand.
</p><p align=left>
Coming ever close the seemingly inexperienced spectre stared as the shadow
wrapped itself around her and cradled her in an envelope of darkness like
a mother holds a child at her breast to prevent it from seeing something it
shouldn't. "Don't watch this", a gentle voice said, "it is going to drive
you barmy if you do." The ghost replied with a hint of anger in her voice:
"I know what is good for me and what isn't, and don't tell me you warned me
this would happen. I know you didn't" There was a sigh that seemed to reach
out into the everlasting mental space of the silver void, rebounding
dancing, echoed and amplified a hunderdfold until it ceased in a
cacophonous crescendo.
</p><p align=left>
"There is something... There is something", the voice echoed through her
like the call of a siren, subtle but alluring and ultimately striking a
deadly blow. "You are forgetting." Those voice sounded sinister like spoken
directly from the deepest pit of the lower planes and had a frightening
finality to it. "You don't know it either", she grumbled. "Return to your
post and leave me alone." With a disappointed shriek the Shadow dissolved
into nothingness, but the scenery had drastically changed...
</p><p align=left>
Bubbles where floating everywhere. Opaque bubbles like shining spheres of
multicoloured magical light, some translucent, revealing wondrous images of
landscapes that where even exotic and impressive from a planewalker's point
of view, but there where far more dark bubbles, writhing and coiling as
though caught in the spasms of nightmares. Ever so slowly the scene seemed
to loose substance and fade away in front of a large room.
</p><p align=left>
A spectral figure blinked and a ghost, who had been a kender not even a
full day ago stirred from her slumber. Funny, why did she know her rest was
called that instead of sleep? She groaned as she felt aching muscles and
stretched lazily to get the stiffness out of her. Slowly walking she
wondered what she was going to do to rid herself of the weariness of her
limbs. Usually a little gymnastics and easy practice should do as they
always did, when she felt like that.
</p><p align=left>
Wait. Spectral bodies weren't supposed to behave like living ones. The
kender looked around and wondered aloud: "Where I am?" <I>Dead, You are
dead</I>, someone whispered into her head repeatedly. "Shut up, I already
know that." Silently she added that she should learn to mentally reply to
the creature in the back of her mind, a creature she was all too familiar
with. She sighed and looked over the hall again. It seemed abandoned and it
seemed strangely quiet for the middle of the Civic Festhall, where there
was constantly entertainment and parties going on.
</p><p align=left>
<I>You can reflow shift and change if you want to. Your Spetuum is an
amorphous blob of matter, changing into whatever you want it to.</I> Bimb
looked at her translucent body and experimentally grew a few tentacles and
eyestalks. It was quite confusing to look into several directions at once,
but definitely a worthwhile experience. She condensed into a small rat and
expanded into a form representing her mortal appearance as she remembered
it.
</p><p align=left>
Next she tried to walk through a wall and was repulsed by more force than
she had expected. <I>Only tiny cracks and rat holes, nothing solid.</I> The
kender wondered: "Weapons can hurt me then?" <I>Only when they are magical,
or claws of paramortals beyond the lowest ranks.</I> "Can I become less
substantial than I already am." <I>Yesss, you can. Come on do it, make me
more powerful.</i> There was a frightening desire in that voice. While Bimb
wondered how she could best deal with her duality, the door of the room
opened and no-one lesser than factol Erin Montgomery entered.
</p><p align=left>
She said: "I thought you where never going to awaken. You slept like dead."
The kender told her: "May I remind you that I <I>am</i> dead." Erin said:
"Sorry, but the way you looked last night I thought I was better going to
remind you." The Kender nodded and said: "You aren't here to chat with a
ghost about her feelings. If I survive this I might record some of it, but
I advise you to be careful with the stuff." Erin agreed with a short nod
and said: "I thought we might need your military expertise." Bimb said: "If
I still have it."
</p><p align=left>
There was more missing than just her body and she had to figure it out very
soon if she wanted to keep going...

Morning, Day Three<br>
Near The Mortuary<br>
**[by Lars H. L&ouml;her]**
</p><p align=left>
Jimora cursed mentally. The three had gone into the mortuary and still they
didn't return. For a moment she pondered if she should follow them, but she
decided against it. The Dustmen had more than enough corpses to do
something about almost any type of trouble, and she should see it coming
before. That didn't keep her from worrying of course. She ducked deeper
into the shadows and shivered from the overwhelming sense of evil pervading
the city.
</p><p align=left>
It was a feeling of seeping hopelessness, of being caught up in a game far
beyond her control. She could only hope Mertian did at least marginally
know what he was doing. Jimora thought she felt a familiar dangerous
presence nearby. Then the group finally left the Mortuary, accompanied by
one of the Dead, who was as pale as a corpse and seemed as uncaring. He had
understood the philosophy, but the assassin wondered if he was going to be
of much help if it came to blows.
</p><p align=left>
Not that an engagement was likely. The clash of arms was audible from
other sections of the city, where faction forces engaged the invading
fiends. Flames flared up and flashes of violent magic lighted the sky, but
even from the distance it seemed more uncoordinated than anything else.
Jimora melded out of the shadows to appear directly in front of the group.
She even managed to frighten the dustman. "Where have you been so
long." Tandin said: "We had information about this type of creature we
had found. It seems to collect brains for further use. We don't know if
they can use anything stored in the brains they... well, collect."
</p><p align=left>
He had almost spoken with the speed of a tinker gnome, but Jimora could
follow it anyway. She might not be a flashy mage, but her mind was keen
enough to survive in one of the most dangerous professions. "If I recall
that tome I read back on my homeworld, they can use the stuff stored there,
but not all of it. I think humanoid thought-structure doesn't translate
well into theirs. That's only my guess and as good as any other." She shook
her head, thinking about the Dabus warrens. Mertian had to be desperate if
he started to gamble like that.
</p><p align=left>
"What-", Tandin started to ask, but Jimora was already gone, leaving the
halfling to wonder, how she could hide like that and even escape his
senses. He was highly attuned to the shadows, but this female gave him
creeps. Jimora had sensed the presence again and her body started to move
with fluid grace. This time she was sure it wasn't some trick of the
desperate situation. Now she did what she was best for, what she had
trained for all those years.
</p><p align=left>
The hunter of hunters, the assassin of assassins, the stalker of stalkers
and she was good at it. She had to be careful, working on the edge of her
formidable endurance. Think about your friends down there. They will die if
you cannot help them. Concentrate on these thoughts as you have learned all
those years ago. Step carefully and deliberately. Move with maximum
efficiency. Never waste any energy for unnecessary steps or even
thoughts.
</p><p align=left>
Finally she became one with the shadows and moved silent as death, just a
deeper shadow in the corner of an eye, that was gone when you turned to
look at it. Several arrows hit the wall and a moment later the snipers lay
sprawled on their bows, barely bleeding. They had instantly died, not even
leaving the heart time to pump blood out of the tiny wound. Don't let your
guard down. These where only minions, the true enemy is still there
stalking you as you stalk him.
</p><p align=left>
There were more snipers with bows and crossbows. There were. No suffering
no warning, just dead. Some of them where just hired mercenaries, but
Jimora was to exhausted to be as selective as she usually was. The minions
where gone, but one still followed her, daggers hitting walls dangerously
near her form. When the supply of daggers was exhausted, crossbow bolts
followed in dangerously rapid succession. Jimora didn't even have the time
to curse her fate as a realisation crept into her mind.
</p><p align=left>
After a wild hunt over Sigil's roofs surrounding the group, weariness
finally got the better of Jimora and she misstepped. Only the blink of an
eye, not even the length of an heartbeat her shadow was pronounced against
a brighter surface. The next crossbow bolt didn't leave the metallic sound
of hitting one of the many blades attached to the structurs, but resounded
with the wet thud of steel hitting flesh at high speed. Jimora spun around and
lost her opponent to the jumble of buildings and alleys surrounding
her.
</p><p align=left>
Knowing, pulling trying to pull the bolt out of her would leave the head in
her body, she pressed the bolt lodged deep in her shoulder with a vicious
effort until the tip broke free of her back. She dislodged it with a
painful effort and pulled the shaft out of her. Jimora's face was a
twisted grimace of agony. Slowly she concentrated on her task, forced her
dazed mind to take control of her body once again. Ever so slowly she
pushed the pain back into the recesses of her unconsciousness to catch the
killer before he found his mark.
</p><p align=left>
Dizziness crept up her spine and Jimora felt the numbness she had just
laboriously forced away returning. Her head swam from the effort and from
something else. She didn't even find the energy to curse mentally as she
realised what it meant.
</p><p align=left>
Poison.

Morning, Day Three<br>
The Civic Festhall<br>
**[by Lars H. L&ouml;her]**
</p><p align=left>
"Yes you have heard me", Erin Montgomery said, "We are relying on your
military knowledge, Captain Moondancer." Bimb favoured her with ignorance
for several moments more and finally she said: "I had to do a self-analysis
to see, what is still intact. I guess I have about less than half my mental
power and half of my memories. Fortunately my military expertise is among
those parts not missing." Not even the experienced factol could hide a sigh
of relief when she heard that.
</p><p align=left>
"See", the factol said, "I am not much of a military leader, and reliving
three dozen recorded battles didn't bring me a step farther either. Even
Darkwood is too much of a loner to be an efficient field commander, but
that doesn't keep him trying. Rhys is too individualistic, Alishon Nilesia can
do a lot of things, but leading armies isn't among them. I think only the
Harmonium and the Godsmen are doing a reasonable job so far, but who is
going to follow the Hardheads? They simply made themselves too many
enemies for anyone to feel comfortable around them."
</p><p align=left>
"I might have lost my leadership ability", Bimb warned. Erin shrugged and
said: "Amber or me can take care of that." The kender nodded and said: "We
meet at the standing horse, tell me the right name of that creature before
I insult one. I have heard they are formidable and fickle. Make sure you
don't stand beneath anything that can crush you." Erin said: "I do remember
the incident at twelve factols quite well." The factol looked at her and
said: "You seem more composed now."
</p><p align=left>
Bimb shrugged and said: "There has to be a reason to keep me going, so I do
what I always did, trying to make the best out of it." Da'nanin asked:
"What about your company?" The kender shrugged and said: "I have three
capable commanders, and I have ordered them to join with my mistress Ithra
Stargazer's company, if I don't return to them. You see I don't even know
if there is a body left to bury, or if they psychic backlash shattered it
beyond repair." While she turned to go Erin mused: "Why did she break down
like that last night?"
</p><p align=left>
Bimb turned around and said: "Have you ever survived the shock if being
ripped apart at the core of your being?" The factol said: "I have relived
being shredded to pieces in from a recording of another sensate ghost." The
kender shook her head and said: "I mean being torn apart in your being, not
your body. I already have experienced the latter at least two times. I am
talking about your mind and your inner being. Can you even begin to even
imagine the emotional shock, especially when you have just turned into a
creature of emotion?"
</p><p align=left>
She finally left leaving behind an unusually thoughtful couple. <I>You
learn fast.</i> I always did. <i>You will try discorporating once.</i> I guess I
have to, to know what it is like and what use it might be in battle.
<i>Once will not strengthen me either</i> I don't care. With that the
Kender dissolved and her ghostly form seemed even more translucent and
radiant than it had before. She passed through several solid barriers
before becoming more solid again.
</p><p align=left>
<i>Do it again</i> And again and Again? You know me better than that. I
need my spectral integrity. You said paramortals can hurt me, and we are
going to battle fiends. There was a sigh in the back of the head. Bimb
allowed herself a short smile of relief. Nothing against knowing your dark
side when you where still alive. She also thanked her mistress for having
the foresight of teaching her these unusual things.
</p><p align=left>
It was time to go on and fight again, most like for more than she
ever had.

Morning, Day Three<br>
An alley in Sigil<br>
**[by Lars H. L&ouml;her]**
</p><p align=left>
"Pray I still have one of those potions", Jimora thought as she reached for
her bag of holding. Her hand moved slower than the blackness that
threatened to engulf her, that seemed to welcome her. Knowing what
failure meant, she refused to yield, refused to let go of the last tiny
spot of light that was dancing in front of her vision. Unable to let go
of the task that she had set for herself, her hand slipped into the bag. It
was easy to find the potions in her well ordered extradimensional
space.
</p><p align=left>
No mistake now, she thought. Concentrate, where did you keep those for
poison. Her head swam and her thoughts seemed to swirl and dance as though
they tried to mock her effort and tried to prove it futile. A single
snippet stayed in the speck of light for a moment and she reached for a
potion, sending another prayer to her god, that she didn't fail at the last
moment. With a last titanic effort she unstoppered the potion and tried to
set it on her lips.
</p><p align=left>
Valuable fluid flowed over her face and she managed to open her mouth. She
licked drops of her lips, before they could flow somewhere else and slowly
her mind seemed to focus again. Finally she managed to set the potion on
the lips and swallow the contents of the flask. During the quickly racing
heartbeats she needed to regain her composure she stored the stainless
steel flask in her bag of holding and wondered a split moment is she had
time to swallow another of her valuable elixirs. She decided against
it.
</p><p align=left>
She was already racing through her shadows again, following her opponent,
finding his trail like a bloodhound following prey. He thought she was out
of the game, so he had relaxed his guard somewhat, knowing he didn't have
to spent valuable energy to strike at the far less skilled group. Leisurely
he stalked through the shadows, his form darting in the deva's direction,
dagger leading. He only noticed the other presence a moment later, a moment
he didn't have as he was struck in the back by a lightening fast dagger and
collapsed to the floor.
</p><p align=left>
Jimora lingered in the shadows a few moments more to be sure he didn't have
any other trick left or was enchanted by a mage to do something nasty. As
neither happened she caught the body before the noise of it falling to the 
floor could betray her position to any minions he might have left. She 
quickly searched the body and wasn't surprised to find a soulsnake on his 
back and the sign of her homeworld's most dangerous thieves' guild around 
his neck. "Night Stalker", she hissed and tossed the sign carelessly to the ground.
</p><p align=left>
Tandin had turned around a few heartbeats after Jimora melded out of the
Shadows. The rest of the group turned only now to see her standing over
the corpse of a slain assassin, who had almost killed them. "You don't
look good", the halfling noted. Pathosis looked at her for several
moments. "No I am not going to die anytime soon, but if the power your
holy symbol indicates gives you the power of healing you better use it
now. I am of little use to either you or Mertian in this state." Pathosis
nodded and finally chanted the runes of the unfamiliar spell.
</p><p align=left>
The shadow walker grimaced as the less-than-gentle spell reknit her flesh
and skin. She pointed at the snake that only seemed a harmless tattoo on
the dead man's back now. "That's the sign of our enemy, if you ask me. I
have heard of that stuff. A thieves' guild on my homeworld uses it on
occasion. It's a nasty and fortunately little known enchantment, that is -
I think - called snake of the soul. It seems harmless, but takes possession
not of your mind, but your very inner being, your soul. I fear our
opponents have easier access to this than this enchantment, that only the
best top-shelf spell-slingers can even hope to comprehend."
</p><p align=left>
The four, even Pathosis, shivered. "Keep cool and watch out." She already
received a gentle mental message from Mertian,  informing where her
assistance was needed next.  Not for the first time she wondered why the
sometimes violent transmissions other members of the network received
didn't plague her. Maybe Mertian thought of her as something special, but
she doubted that any mortal would ever have a special meaning to the
ancient cosmic player. More likely it was somehow connected to her own
mind. Either she had Shadow Walker abilities she didn't know about, or it
was the wild talent she had not used for years.
</p><p align=left>
"What is this all about?", the mephit asked, after being silent for an
unusually long time. Jimora shrugged and said with her best indifferent
voice: "It is all a game of cosmic chess. Mertian and the creature
controlling those brain-things and also the assassin I killed are the
players, or at least they think they are. With the multiverse being the
mess it is, they might again only be figures of some even more powerful
players." Someone wanted to ask a question.
</p><p align=left>
Jimora was already gone.

Morning, Day Three<br>
A Prime World<br>
**[by Lars H. L&ouml;her]**
</p><p align=left>
In a world, whose name isn't important, a kender opened her eyes and looked
around. Where was she? What had happened. She surveyed her surroundings and
surmised she was in a hut somewhere. A robed figure with a concerned
expression in her face was leaning over her. "I though you where dead", the
other female said. "Wouldn't be the first time I stop breathing", the
kender noted. The other female nodded only and asked: "What happened. You
looked agonised."
</p><p align=left>
The kender did so again. "I... I have... been... ripped... torn... apart."
Obviously she was lacking the adequate words, which was something that
rarely happened to the resourceful and unusual kender. She closed her eyes
again and performed a self-analysis. "My soul", she whispered in a toneless
voice. "It's missing." The robed female said: "You should be dead then,
even liches have souls, even though they have to store it in a gem." The
kender shook her head and said: "My mind, or whatever is left of it keeps
me going, but it will not do so for long.
</p><p align=left>
"It costs me most of my energy to keep my body from decaying and have it
stay in a reasonable shape. I cannot lead you anytime soon." The robed
female asked: "How do you feel?" Bimbalina replied: "Hollow, empty, lost. I
still have part of my mind. You know I split personality, when I entered
the City of Doors, so I could quickly react to local danger, so my mind was
split by something that looked like the Lady of Pain, but along other
lines than my original separation.
</p><p align=left>
"Something strikes me as odd." The robed female asked: "What?" The kender
closed her eyes, her features twitching nervously several times. "After all
my mistress told me about the Lady of Pain, she shouldn't just have cut the
silver cord. She should have sliced my mind, the way she slices everything
near her with her blades. Ithra said even from a distance the blades left
almost lethal psychic impressions and even she was barely able to return
to the physical world in time to survive." The mage said: "That's odd."
Bimb nodded and said: "Yes it is." The robed female asked: "What if
this figure wasn't Her Serenity?"
</p><p align=left>
A disturbing and frightening thought indeed.

</p><p align=left>
A carelessly tossed coin spins and dances. It doesn't just leap and fall
over the cobblestones the way a coin thrown like this one should. Neither
did it move like the whirlwind depicted on both sides. There was no
discernible pattern, not even a slaad's tongue guess, what it was going
to do next, leaping spinning, dancing happily and eerily in its agitated
Limbo dance.
</p><p align=left>
A few glimmers of light, unfathomable patterns again. Then more and more
entwining dancing turning to flame, ice, acid and air in moments, radiate
again and collapse. Slowly moving into the direction of a like-minded soul,
a being so deeply unpredictable, that Limbo was going to fetch it even from
the locked cage, ignoring any rules as it always did. Attracted and called
by its destination, the swirl engulfs a body. Run to Limbo, throwing
off the shackles of possession and mortality.
</p><p align=left>
The corpse of the assassin Jimora had killed twitches and seems to move
without animation. Parts become amorphous, change ever more and more
randomly. Encompassing, slowly encroaching the chaos mater engulfs the
dead body and the body becomes chaos matter, returns to the element it
always longed for. Slowly weakening, limbo seeps out of the cage again. A
multicoloured flash across the silver void and then nothing, only time- and
spaceless nothingness covered by the illusion of silvery stars. A soul
revels in its freedom.

Mid-morning, Day Three (...or is it a steamed duck?)<br>
Limbo<br>
**[by Shelaam]**
</p><p align=left>
Looking at the road, Cray had to admit it, Bliss was good. If fact, he was
damn good.
</p><p align=left>
Delva's shield had initially protected them well as the mismatched group
was swept through the vortex into the churning ocean of untamed anarchy
that was Limbo. The plane was everything and nothing at once, the
environment changing from seething magma to deepest void, and again to a
desertscape twisted beyond the imagination of the most crazed artist, all
without word or warning, rhyme or reason. To Cray's mind, it was beautiful.
</p><p align=left>
But, despite being the home of chaos, it was well known to planewalkers
that a cutter with a strong will and keen mind could impose a bit of order
on the place, shaping his surounds to his will and whim. Knowing that
Delva's magic would soon fail, it was decided that Bliss should try his
hand at what was colloquially known as 'chaos shaping'. The illithid's
initial modest attempt had gone well, changing a small area directly around
them to a dusty plain.
</p><p align=left>
Cray distinctly remembered that it was Harpsichord who had eagerly
suggested that "it'd be nice to have a tad more space between us an' the
goop o'erhead, so's we could all get a good breather, like", and so Bliss
changed the surroundings a little, and they were walking along a long dirt
trail, a respectable distance of 'sky' above them. When the trail widened
slightly and became paved with flagstones, he'd begun to suspect that Bliss
was getting a little over ambitious, but it hadn't stopped there. 
</p><p align=left>
The group was now taking a quick rest at a spring which had suddenly
appeared beside their path. Harpsichord was meticulously examining one of
the bronze 'milestones' which had recently begun to spring up on the
wayside, while the illithid stared contentedly at the recurring mosaics,
intricately detailed pictures of the Godsman motif studded into the centre
of the road.
</p><p align=left>
Of course, slapping a fancy new road through the middle of the countryside
isn't exactly the sort of thing that makes the locals happy.  Cray had
anticipated this problem, and when the natives had shown up to voice their
objections in their own quaint manner (by reducing the offenders to their
component parts), he'd taken advantage of local custom and demanded single
combat with their leader, a motley old fellow named Quorbosh. Despite the
fact that his followers vastly outnumbered the travellers, the green slaad
had been honour bound to comply. It had all worked out rather nicely, Cray
mused, despite a few aching bruises he bore.
</p><p align=left>
He was broken from his reverie by the grunting slurps of the new 'guide',
apparently what passed for communication amongst the slaadi, great toadish
horrors who were the only truly native inhabitants of the plane. Quorbosh
apparently meant that the scouts sent out some time earlier had returned
with news that the destination was close - his froglike minions were
perfectly adapted to weathering the fickle conditions of the plane. The
guiding device Cray had taken from Sigil told him this as well, linked as
it was to the beacon or 'Guidon' as their destination, but magic was
notoriously fickle in Limbo, and the slaadi knew the place like the back of
their claws. He smiled once again at their good fortune at being attacked,
and stood up, signaling that the rest was at an end
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
The companions looked downwards into the great, ragged hole which seemed to
devour the end of Bliss' mosaic road, and Harpsichord breathed a low
whistle of astonishment. "Then this'd be yer Pinwheel, eh, bosun".
</p><p align=left>
The Pinwheel was an immense island with its own atmosphere, keeping out the
ravaging chaos soup by itself in a way which scholars could only argue
over. It reportedly had its own gravity as wellAlthough carpeted by thick
forest and inhabited by ferocious beasts, it was one of the few stable
patches of land on the whole plane, and thus a popular site for meetings
and gatherings. To this effect, a great Guidon pyramid had been constructed
at the island's heart.
</p><p align=left>
With the help of the slaadi reports, Bliss had been able to direct his road
so it touched the top of the atmospheric bubble near the very centre of the
island. The purpose of this was not so that the four friends could enjoy a
luxurious mile long plummet to the rocky surface of the Pinwheel, but to
take advantage of the other unique feature of the island. For, curling
majestically from the rocky prominence in the centre of the Pinwheel,
gnarled and ancient as the Multiverse itself, climbed a silver root of
Yggdrasil, the mighty World Ash. The tree's branches and roots were said to
span every plane and age, and a canny planewalker knew that, as a means of
getting from A to B, travel of the Ash could hardly be beat.
</p><p align=left>
After a brief conference, Cray dismissed Quorbosh and his bloodthirsty
band. The massive toad bowed subserviently to Cray, almost groveling, and
he shook his head in wonder at the strange slaadi code. Killers to whom
mercy and remorse were alien concepts, a slaad would make a meal out of you
and use your head as a kick-ball if he thought he could. But for some
reason they placed a huge amount of worth on individual might; if you could
show that you could best any basher in the vicinity, one on one, they'd all
lick your boots and bring you breakfast on command. 
</p><p align=left>
*We'd best get out of here swiftly,* projected Bliss. *Once word gets out
that you bested Quorbosh, we'll have slaadi rushing from half a plane away
to be the first to take your scalp*
</p><p align=left>
The others nodded their agreement, and Bliss 'thought' a path leading
around the outside of the Pinwheel's air bubble, being very careful lest
the solid seeming road collapse into the island's stronger reality, an
eventuality which would leave about thirty seconds to learn how to fly.
Soon enough the churning elements at the edge of Bliss' stable hemisphere
gave way to a rolling mist.
</p><p align=left>
"Yggdrasil," declared Cray. 
</p><p align=left>
"I sure was a hand at tree climin' when I was a lass," volunteered
Harpsichord with a snaggle toothed grin, "p'raps I'll have m'self a tad
peek before you lot of golbodgers blunder yerselves into trouble". Brooking
no argument, she slipped off into the mist.
</p><p align=left>
About ten seconds later, a strangled yawp was heard. Cray pulled his chiv,
and the three cautiously made their way into the mist The great root soon
materializing in front of them, but neither Harpsichord or her assailant
could be seen.
</p><p align=left>
Then a familiar voice echoed from below "Take a care as to where you're
puttin' yer feet. This tree's right slippery." Harpsichord appeared
shimmying up the numerous lesser roots, branches and nodules that crusted
the face of the wood, deranged grin plastered over her face. "The luck o'
Hermes I tested it first, or who knows what problems the likes of yerselves
would've had".
</p><p align=left>
Cray sighed with resignation, sheathed his sword, and wordlessly took a
firm grasp on the great tree.
</p>

Among the branches of Yggdrasil<br>
**[by Shelaam]**
</p><p align=left>
"Y' can make me kiss a gehreleth if I'm wrong, but I'm wagering we're more
lost than a ship full of Athar. Yer gerbil buddies seem t' be mighty scarce
in these parts, Cray."
</p><p align=left>
Annoying as it was, Harpsichord was right. Cray had used the World Ash many
times on his trip around the ring, and ratatosk, the cunning little
squirrels that made Yggdrasil their home had always been there, pranksters
but always willing to guide a lost basher in exchange for a trinket, tidbit
or riddle. Here, however, the creatures seemed to be absent, and the last
hour had been spent vainly trying to pick a path amongst the intertwining,
silvery limbs. Success was markedly absent, and rather than find a way to
the howling tunnels of Pandemonium, they remained in the misty place
between planes that was the World Ash.
</p><p align=left>
Throwing his arms up in frustration, Cray bit back a sharp retort. "All
right, so maybe they don't like it near the lower planes, I don't know.
Maybe someone else has a better plan for finding a path." Surprisingly, it
was Delva who spoke up. She had been silent for a long time, and was still
very pale in the face. Now she looked confused, her eyes darting wildly.
</p><p align=left>
"I... I seem to recall... something. This place seems... familiar "
</p><p align=left>
Without warning, she threw her head back and let loose a wild keen,
high-pitched enough to shatter crystal, just on the edge of perception, and
with an intensity to touch the soul. Cray and Harpsichord stuffed their
fingers in their ears, trying to escape the spine-chilling wail. 
</p><p align=left>
Bliss, who did not hear in the ordinary sense of the word, was not so
discomforted, and seized the moment. An anomaly amongst his kind, the
caring Bliss was generally respectful of the privacy of other beings'
thoughts. But something worried Bliss about the enigmatic mage, a concern
about her mysterious past awakened by her outburst at the Feast and Famine.
Brushing her mind with a gentle probe, Bliss detected the dark morass of
memory that was her hidden past.
</p><p align=left>
He pressed more forcefully, bending his will to the task, but the mage's
mind was strong, difficult to penetrate. He caught a glimpse of an image,
part of the dark film that had wrapped Delva's memories into a bundle,
storing them away from her conscious mind - an image of spiders,
everywhere, smothering the walls of a great cave, of fangs and bloated
abdomen and red eyes which pierced the darkness, of jointed, spiny-furred
legs which crawled up your body and face, filling mouth, eyes, mind...
</p><p align=left>
...Bliss jerked his mind back with a start, and realised that Delva's wail
was dying down, and she herself was looking around with great confusion as
if astonished with what she'd done. Cray and Harpsichord slowly recovered
their heads from between their legs, the latter muttering a few inventive
oaths from her seemingly endless repertoire, and looked tentatively towards
the mage in case a second helping was on the menu.
</p><p align=left>
When it seemed to Cray that the danger of having his eardrums ruptured had
passed, he started to ask what had happened, but was cut off by the sound
of scuttling legs and swooshing wings which grew swiftly louder. Within
moments, a squirrel landed on the branch with a thud, obviously having
glided in from great height. The creature was a ratatosk, but unlike any
Cray had ever seem, for its fur was pure silvery-white, and its skin hung
in great wrinkles which would have seemed comic if not for the great
dignity it carried itself with. To everyone's astonishment, the diminutive
elder strode toward Delva with purpose, abasing himself before her
completely.
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, Great Mistress," the ratotosk intoned solemnly in a voice which was at
one piping and drawn with age, "I, Bierer of Bristletail clan hear and obey
the ancient call. I am yours to command".
</p><p align=left>
Delva seemed as amazed as the rest at Bierer's dramatic appearance, but the
venerable creature remained prone in obeisance. Cray was perplexed, as he
had never seen a ratatosk which was not jovial and mischievous, let alone
one as wizened and serious as the specimen at hand. 
</p><p align=left>
The mage soon recovered her wits. "Er... rise, noble Bierer," she commanded,
trying to summon as much authority as possible "your task is at once simple
and of great urgency. You must lead my... retainers and I to the town known
as Windglum, deep within the plane of Pandemonium."
</p><p align=left>
"As you say, Mistress, it shall be done. A thin root, shooting off that
which leads to the Winter Hall of Loki, grounds near this place. It is very
close to here."
</p><p align=left>
"Lead on, then, my brave servant," Delva replied, not entirely sure of
herself but masking it well.
</p><p align=left>
Bierer bowed deeply, his bush tail sticking high in the air. He turned, and
wordlessly motioned for the companions to follow him along the path of
slivered wood.

Peak, Day Three<br>
The Astral Plane<br>
**[by Yingzhi Zhang]**
</p><p align=left>
Mertian hovered in the middle of the emptiness, a single white thread of
shimmering light winding its way into the depths of his mind.  A vital
white thread that fed him the information he needed to act, now that his
globe had been destroyed.  While Cray's mission was apparently going well,
Abigail's outburst was troubling.  Partly because of her amnesia, and
partly because normally not even Mertian could penetrate the dark recesses
of her mind that had so abruptly revealed itself.  Something about her felt
eerily familiar...  Feeling a presence, Mertian detatched himself from the
Mindspider's thread and turned around.  
</p><p align=left>
Ninety seven aurumachs hovered silently in the Silver Void.  Ninety seven
pairs of golden eyes stared at Mertian gravely.  Ninety seven minds now all
focused upon him.  The significance of the missing ninety-eighth aurumach
was not lost on Mertian.  
</p><p align=left>
"As you requested, Mertian, we have come.  What have you found that is so
important it tears us from our duties?" one of the aurumachs asked in a
deep voice.
</p><p align=left>
"Undoubtedly you have all felt the reverberations throughout the
multiverse," Mertian began. "Reverberations caused by the mere presence of
one from beyond.  Eons have passed, and He has returned."  
</p><p align=left>
The aurumachs murmured briefly among themselves, but did not appear
altogether surprised.  That was not unexpected - they would hardly be
aurumachs if they didn't already feel the repercussions of the Enemy's
presence upon the fabric of reality itself.  
</p><p align=left>
"How can you be sure of this, Mertian?" the deep-voiced aurumach asked.
"It is true there have been troubling disturbances within the depths of the
Multiverse, and within Sigil itself.  However, this does not necessarily
constitute His return..." 
</p><p align=left>
"He approached me in my own sanctum," Mertian replied simply.  
</p><p align=left>
More murmuring, though with a much more surprised overtone.  
</p><p align=left>
"Now, perhaps more than ever, we need to be as one," Mertian said
definitively, looking pointedly at the spot where the missing ninety-eigth
aurumach would be, were he here. "We cannot defeat this enemy if we
constantly battle among ourselves.  We must be united in our purposes."  
</p><p align=left>
"You and he have ever been at odds, Mertian," another aurumach asserted.
"He would likely go his own way, as you often do.  However, due to the
significance of this event, we will make an attempt to bring him around."  
</p><p align=left>
There was a pause.  
</p><p align=left>
"And what of the other races?" someone asked from the back. "They are
numerous, and may be quite useful.  Perhaps some effort should be made to
inform them of the upcoming crisis."  
</p><p align=left>
"No," Mertian shook his head. "The other races were not present when he
came the last time.  They are too young and would not understand the depth
of the situation.  They would undoubtedly begin squabbling and fighting
among themselves, and we cannot spend the time trying to smooth over their
differences.  Time enough to inform them if the situation becomes too
critical."  
</p><p align=left>
"What of the yugoloths?  They are eldest of the younger races, and were
present when he last came." 
</p><p align=left>
Mertian considered it. "It is a possibility.  The yugoloths are strong,
and have a powerful influence over the events in the lower planes.  They
are, however, notoriously untrustworthy."
</p><p align=left>
"I will personally go...as representative of all rilmani," the deep-toned
aurumach stated solemly. "The yugoloth must be made to understand this
crisis overshadows personal ambitions.  Fickle or not, they as a whole are
not stupid, and they will certainly realize the consequences of His return."
</p><p align=left>
The last question came hesistantly. "What of the One?" 
</p><p align=left>
Mertian groaned inwardly.  It was an inevitability, he supposed, that
someone would bring up that age-old question.  He silently berated himself
for not forseeing it.  
</p><p align=left>
"The One has been lost," the deep-voiced aurumach replied with the tone of
an adult speaking to a young child. "He has been lost since the Dark One
last came, and in the eons between we have yet to see signs of his return."
</p><p align=left>
"Perhaps some effort should be made to locate him..." the other mused.
"His power gave us victory last time, when we met the Enemy upon the field
of battle."  
</p><p align=left>
"That battle came at the expense of over nine-tenths our number and two
entire planes.  The Great Ring cannot withstand another such costly
victory, and neither can we.  This time, we need to proceed greater
discretion."  
</p><p align=left>
"But we have grown in power and numbers.  We should start mobilizing now.
If we strike quickly, before He has time to manifest all His power, we may
have a chance, perhaps even to banish Him forever."  
</p><p align=left>
"For all our power, His is still greater.  You forget - time has likely
increased his power as well."
</p><p align=left>
"There is no need for fighting, brothers," Mertian interceded. "We can
pursue both courses of action.  All effort should be taken to block His
entry into the Outer Planes, but should that fail, we must also be prepared
to strike quickly and, hopefully, decisively.  In the meantime, my own
forces will attempt to secure Sigil, to prevent Him from attempting to
manifest His power through its portals."

"Very well, then Mertian.  Do as you see fit.  You shall not fail," the
deep-voiced rilmani said solemnly.  
</p><p align=left>
"We shall not fail," Mertian agreed.  
</p><p align=left>
"We are Rilmani...." With the traditional parting triad, the ninety-seven
rilmani vanished.  
</p><p align=left>
A chill ran down Mertian's spine as he gazed at the empty space where the
rilmani floated just a moment ago.  Deep in his mind, he thought he heard
laughter.  Mocking, derisive laughter that had just a touch of malevolent
irony.  
</p><p align=left>
Mertian suddenly felt a lot less certain of himself.  
</p><p align=left>
"We are rilmani," he snarled into the empty void.  
</p><p align=left>
The laughter continued for several long moments, then vanished.

Early Afternoon, Day Three<br>
Among the branches of Yggdrasil<br>
**[by Yingzhi Zhang]**
</p><p align=left>
Bliss was tired.  They'd been climbing the roots of Yggdrasil for the past
hour, and to be quite honest, his illithid heritage wasn't prepared to
spend long periods of time scurrying about on a plane-spanning tree.  After
all, how many trees do you get to see when you spent most of your childhood
in a leaky, sunless cavern?  However, seeing as how coming along had been
his idea in the first place, he resolutely kept his complaints to himself.  
</p><p align=left>
It wouldn't be so bad if Cray and the others were at least somewhat tired.
 Then, at least, he'd be able to salvage some of his pride.  Unfortunately,
Cray seemed to have hit a bout of good cheer (unusual and, Bliss
considered, highly suspicious behavior for a Bleaker) and was moving along
at a torturously brisk pace.  Even that curious woman, Abigail, was moving
faster than he was.  Bliss sighed, rolled up the hem of his robe to prevent
it from catching on his feet, and moved on.  
</p><p align=left>
The attack came almost without warning.  With only a slight rustle of
leaves to preface them, an enormous swarm of black beetles came flying out
of the foliage, the sound of their wings like the rain upon a field.  Bliss
had only enough time to vainly raise his arms.  
</p><p align=left>
The next thing he knew, he was surrounded on all sides by the infernal
beetles.  They burrowed into his robes, up into his sleeves, biting and
clawing at his tender flesh.  He screeched, mostly with alarm, and slapped
at them, but seemed only to encourage the onslaught.  Somewhere nearby,
Bliss heard shouts of consternation, followed by cursing.  Lots and lots of
the foulest cursing Bliss had ever heard from a definitely feminine source.
</p><p align=left>
Then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the beetles vanished,
disappeared back into the dense network of leaves.  While no one had been
seriously hurt, or bore what could be considered minor wounds, the surprise
attack was a little frightening.  Harpsichord dashed a short distance after
the beetles, waving her arms and shouting incoherently.
</p><p align=left>
"Is everyone alright?" Bliss asked, looking around.
</p><p align=left>
"We're fine," Cray replied, staring at Harpsichord. "What in Baator was that?" 
</p><p align=left>
"Given the circumstances, I'd say it was a swarm of large black beetles,"
Bliss replied sardonically.  
</p><p align=left>
"That wasn't what I meant." 
</p><p align=left>
"Then you should say what you mean."  
</p><p align=left>
Harpsichord came walking back, still muttering darkly under her breath.
</p><p align=left>
"They got away, Mr. Cray," she said slightly disconsolately.
</p><p align=left>
"Ah...that's alright, Harpsichord," Cray replied carefully. "Ready to go?" 
</p><p align=left>
"Our guide is indisposed," Bliss observed flatly.  
</p><p align=left>
They turned.  The aged ratatosk was literally gibbering in terror, and it
was running around and around the branch they were standing on with
surprising speed.  Evidently, something about the attack frightened it far
more than it did them.  
</p><p align=left>
"Wonderful," Cray said acidly.
</p><p align=left>
It took them the better part of the day to calm it down enough for them to
continue.

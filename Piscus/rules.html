  In addition to knowing who wrote the stories, you might (or might not) be interested in knowing
  exactly what sort of ground rules we laid down in order to bring some kind of order to this rather
  hectic and ambitious project.  Well, here they are...
</p>
<center><font color=red face="Visitation">
<h2>The PlaneScape Chain Story Group Guidelines</h2>
<h4>(PSCS, pronounced "piscus", rhymes with "discus")</h4>
</font></center>
<p align=left>
  *  We the authors, in order to form a more perfect form of entertainment,
  have banded together to write chain stories based in and around the
  Planescape campaign universe.  In the interest of bandwidth, we have
  segregated ourselves from the PS mailing list and are mailing our
  missives only amongst ourselves.
</p><p align=left>
  *  The stories thus far completed may be found at Ken Lipka's Planescape
  Fiction Archive, located at http://www.deathstar.org/~krlipka/ps/fiction/index.html.
  Ken has graciously volunteered to host the list and to act as a mini-moderator.
  The e-mail addresses of the authors may be found on the same page.
</p><p align=left>
  *  Furthermore, we have divided up into two (mostly overlapping) groups;
  one dedicated to writing a "silly" PS chain story, and one concentrating
  on writing a serious one.
</p><p align=left>
  Therefore, mail going to PSCS ([REDACTED]) should be, if possible,
  divided into one of three groups and given an appropriate header in the subject line:
<br><br><blockquote>
  Chain:  goes out to all of PSCS, a general announcement.<br>
  Silly:  goes out only to those contributing/reading the silly segments.<br>
  Serious:  ditto, only for the serious story.
</blockquote>
</p><p align=left>
  *  The stories being written are *chain* stories.  This means that
  authors should be aware of what has gone before and be prepared to
  respond in an appropriate manner.  Sub-plots are allowed, but they
  should weave back into the main story once in a while.  
</p><p align=left>
  This is *not* a shared universe series, in which characters go off and
  have their own adventures to the backdrop of a common theme. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>--Serious Story: Characters--</h3>
</p><p align=left>
  *  Authors have a great amount of control over *all* of the characters,
  including ones created by other authors.  The only limit is that one
  author may not kill or mutilate (in all senses of the word) another
  author's character without express permission to do so from the creator.
</p><p align=left>
  Common courtesy should always be a limit as well, but officially, we
  all have the right to drive the story where we want to when we're behind
  the wheel.  Thus, the following <u>warning</u> should be observed:
</p><p align=left><blockquote>
  *Don't* put a favored character into the story that you don't want
  anyone else to touch!  If the story goes on at length and what you've
  written is *interesting*, other people *will* fool with them and *will*
  alter whatever plans you've got!
</blockquote></p><p align=left>
  *  You should post a character summary about any major character you
  create to the subhead you're involved with.  Example from Ken Lipka:
  (posted to the 'silly' list)
</p><p align=left><blockquote><i>
> MEASURE THREE NARTHE:  Male Human, Harmonium.  Member of Hive<br>
> Patrol squad.  Ambitious, single-minded, not too observant.<br>
> Fits the "law-and-order jarhead" image to a T.  Main goal is to<br>
> arrest Quake and shut down her bar.
</i></blockquote></p><p align=left>
  This will enable other authors to write about your characters without
  totally screwing them up.
</p><p align=left>
  *  There's no theoretical limit to the number of characters the authors
  may make up.  There are practical limits, however, so please think twice
  when making up a major player.  Other, already created characters may
  fill the role just as well as a new one.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>--Serious Story: Plots--</h3>
</p><p align=left>
  *  The only plotline previously agreed to by all here is that Sigil, the
  City of Doors, is being invaded and the Lady is not openly responding,
  at least on a level easily observable.  How, why, by whom, etc. are all
  questions that will be answered during the creation of the story.
</p><p align=left>
  *  PS Canon is to be observed at all times.  No one is to break with
  established rules, no matter how much you might like to.  The Lady of
  Pain remains inviolate, no powers may appear in Sigil, the Blood War
  divides the fiends, etc.
</p><p align=left>
  Some authors have gone so far as to state that they will not be using
  "official" TSR NPCs, but if you do, you must stick to known facts and
  personalities.
</p><p align=left>
  In particular, there is a strong feeling that the Lady is to be
  treated with nothing short of total respect.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>--Serious Story: Submissions--</h3>
</p><p align=left>
  *  Serious story submissions are accepted on a rotating basis, working
  alphabetically down the 'serious' author list.  Each author has a time
  limit of 5 days; if his/her piece is not submitted within that time, the
  next author in line is notified to proceed.
</p><p align=left>
  *  Ken Lipka will notify authors when their turn to write is imminent. 
  A 'yellow light' message means you are next in line, a 'green light'
  message means it's your turn now and your 5-day limit is ticking.
</p><p align=left>
  *  Submission length has not been limited, but please don't abuse the
  process.  There are 23 authors who would all like an equal chance to be
  read, so please don't hog the story with gargantuan posts.  Suggestions
  have been made to keep individual submissions down to a couple of
  scenes.  There is no minimum limit either, but story submissions should
  at least advance the plot somewhat, even if they're only a paragraph or
  two long.
</p><p align=left>
  *  If an author cannot post an article within the prescribed time, his/
  her turn passes until the next run through the author list.  If you know
  you will be unavailable at a certain time to write, please alert Ken as
  soon as possible so that the writing torch may be quickly passed to the
  next author in line.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>--The Silly Story:  Plots--</h3>
</p><p align=left>
  *  The plotline here is summed up by the title of the story, <i>"A Night at
  Quake's Place"</i>.  It's an anything-goes night of highjinks at a colorful
  Sigilian Xaositect bar.  The sillier and more amusing the contribution,
  the better.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>--Silly Story: Submissions--</h3>
</p><p align=left>
  *  Silly story submissions are accepted in any order, in the order they are
  received.  If two submission come in at the same time which openly conflict
  with one another, Ken Lipka will attempt to reconcile the problems while leaving
  the general idea and text of each submission intact.
</p><p align=left>
  *  There is no time limit for submissions (rather hard given a lack of a
  definite order).  Instead, the story will continue ad nasuem until either some
  one writes a section from which no one can figure out where to go, or the
  majority of the authors on the project decide to kill it.
</p><p align=left>
  *  As with the serious story, submission length has not been limited.  And
  likewise, this should not be abused.  All we ask is that you leave at least
  something for the other authors to react to - either a new character, or
  some new event for reactions to be written for.

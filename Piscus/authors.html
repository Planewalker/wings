  There is actually a large number of people from the Planescape Mailing List who are
  interested in trying their hand at a Chain Story project or two.  After much discussion,
  we, as a group, decided to work only on two stories - one silly, and one serious.
  Unfortunately, as the work on the Serious story has picked up, the Silly story has fallen
  by the wayside.  As such, I've decided to only list the authors involved in the Serious
  story - besides, this list serves as a guide to the writing assignment order.

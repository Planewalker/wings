Ah, my little pawn is fighting his first battle. I knew Grazlen wouldn't
resist picking a fight with my little warrior. He has no chance against the
fiend, but he could injure him enough to lose face, and his chance of being
promoted to green will be none. What a waste though, this mortal, Bane could
have been useful for a few battles, but now. Here he comes, he is a pathetic
little mortal, but he is a lot less pathetic than most. They didn't provide him
armor? His feeble skin couldn't stand a chance against Grazlen! I heard that
Bane was able to keep up with him running across Avernus, impressive for a
worthless mortal. He holds that sword like a warrior, but that isn't going to
save him against the might of a Baatezu. The Barbazau pointed him to his
corner. Mortals have these fights too, I saw one in Sigil, but few are worthy
for a fight in Baator. The warriors are only Mortal, and not all of them are to
the death. No fiend has ever lost a combat in a ring of honorable combat, so
even a mortal like Bane should not even come close to winning. Grazlen arrived
out his side of the arena, he didn't carry a weapon, he doesn't need one, like
the feeble mortals do. Besides my whip, natural weapons and powers work the
best.

The fireball is launched in the air as the signal to fight, of course, the dumb
mortal doesn't realize this, and Grazlen charges Bane with his claws extended.
Bane gets in a stance, which I have seen as some sort of mortal fighting
stance, and strikes just before Grazlen's claws would reach him. It was a good
hit, actually cleaved a scale. Grazlen's claws slash his sides, and Bane
stumbles. He turns and strikes again hitting Grazlen in the head. This is more
than I hoped! I actually see a trickle of blood fall from his blackened brow.
Yes! The Humiliation! I'll put Bane under my wing when he is made a Lemure,
give him a chance to promote to Spinagon. Grazlen will never live this down.
Even in the bloody state Bane is in, he managed to dodge his claws, but not his
tail. Bane falls. Grazlen grabs his legs and pulls him up into the sky. It's
over, Sigh! I knew it wouldn't last. My little pawn is flailing as Grazlen
flies up to a height above the ring, with the mortal clutched in his claws.
Grazlen is smarter than I thought, complete humiliation of the mortal will make
up for a "lucky strike". I can hear him now "I was toying with the mortal."
Wait! Bane just slashed Grazlen's wing. He pulled up his body and slashed, the
wing ripped, not seriously, but enough to hurt.

Bane fell from the sky, another splattered mortal, no, he landed with a splash
in a river of blood outside the arena. Grazlen looks furious, oh what pleasure
this mortal is giving me. Bane pulled himself out of the river, still gripping
his sword. This is a bold mortal managed to dodge his dive. Bane slashed
Grazlen, a red slash marked his body.  Grazlen batted the mortal away. Bane had
his weak frame had red streams of blood trailing from his face and over his
body...mmm mortal blood, tastes so good. I will have to find some berk to
bleed, or maybe after Grazlen's kills Bane.. Nah, he'll feast on him. Bane's
sword plunged into Grazlen. The Silver blade plunged into the spot where he
clipped the scale. Grazlen toppled to the blackened ground. I don't believe it,
I don't think anyone in the crowd believes it either. A mortal has slain one of
our own. I will have to use some of my pull to keep him alive, my pawn not only
humiliated Grazlen, but now he is dead, and no longer a threat. The Dark Eight
was actually going to promote Grazlen, and be a major threat to me. A jump from
Black Abashai to Hamatula is a huge promotion, and now he's gone, back to
lemure status, most likely a meal for me, when I find him. I better go quickly,
it'll be the best meal I have had in centuries.

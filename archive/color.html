<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shouldered his way between the two men who stood
guard at the doors to the Barracks Auditorium. Glaring, they only offered
token resistance before allowing him to pass. Pushing open the thick, iron-braced
doors, he found himself the focus of several disapproving stares. The worst
came from the stage itself, behind the podium. An imposing seven feet tall,
encased in gleaming platemail armor made from red steel, Factol Sarin was
nothing if not intimidating.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Factol waited until Ryan had seated himself among
the few hundred other members of the Harmonium before speaking. “Now that
we’re all here,” Ryan winced. “We can continue. As I was saying, the last
couple of weeks have gone very well, and I fully expect next week to go
equally smoothly. In four days the Sensates will be holding their triannual
Festival of Sensation, so there will be extra patrols assigned to the Clerk’s
Ward area. We usually don’t have much trouble with the festival, so those
of you assigned can expect to be running crowd control most of the time.
There’re always a few Sensates that shoot for some of the more unlawful
sensations though, so keep sharp while you’re there.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Our second order of business concerns the Fraternity
of Order. In order to-“ he paused to shuffle through his notes and scrutinize
a thick packet. “’Promote compatibility and order between the three administrations
of government and law within the city-state of Sigil, (See Appendix C,
clause 27, sub-clause 15)…” He paged quickly to the back of the booklet.
There were several smiles and a few low chuckles from the men and women
in the audience. “’All matters referring to the city-state of Sigil pertain
to the city of Sigil, an autonomous community of individuals residing or
traveling within the as of yet undefined limits of the aforementioned city,
structures located within the undefined limits of that city, and all other
entities and objects not classified by the previous two definitions which
can be said to exist within the undefined limits of said city, (see Appendix
I, clause 12…” With an over-exaggerated sigh he dropped the packet back
to the top of the podium. It landed heavily on the wood and echoed briefly
through the large auditorium.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He leaned forward with his elbows on the podium.
“The gist of it is that they want to send observers along with our patrols.
The Mercykillers received the same booklet as well. Every time the matter
was brought up in the Hall of Speakers before now, I’ve been able to put
them off. We don’t need a bunch of Guvners wandering underfoot, getting
in the way. My excuse has been that it’s too dangerous, but with the way
it’s been lately I haven’t had that recourse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’ve been able to argue them down to just four of
these observers per ward. You will be told after general patrol assignments
are given out whether one of these observers will be going along with you.
If you do have to take one on, just let them be and do your job. Try not
to get them penned in the dead-book, but a few lumps won’t do them much
harm. They’re just an annoyance to be endured until they realize the truth
of it. They may conduct the trials, but we enforce the Peace.” There was
a murmur of approval from the assembled officers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Having finished his briefing, Sarin launched into
the reading off of the duty roster for the next week. Each officer was
assigned to one of the six wards of the city and a superior to report to.
After the briefing they would go to receive their individual orders and
assignments. Ryan listened absently, noting who had been reassigned and
whose patrols remained unchanged. It was a matter of pride among the Harmonium
who was assigned to the Hive. If you were assigned to the crime-ridden
ward, it meant that the high-ups thought you were up to keeping the Peace
in a hostile environment. After the first week, if you were reassigned
it meant that you couldn’t handle it. If you were able to keep your assignment
though, you and everyone else started keeping track. Every week that passed
without reassignment you got a tiny circular steel chit marked with the
Harmonium symbol.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s personal collection, carried in a pouch at
his belt, totaled sixty chits, fifteen months of consecutive duty. His
streak had ended with a riot that had sent him to the infirmary with a
broken leg and three stab wounds a year ago. The overall record was held
by Tonat Shar, Sarin’s second in command: one hundred and fifty-six chits,
marking three years of duty in the Hive.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Sarin called Ryan’s name and his ears perked up.
“Clerk’s Ward, Commander Wheally.” Ryan grimaced, remembering Sarin’s opening
words. Crowd control.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the briefing had ended, Ryan made his way through
the departing throng of Harmonium officers to the front desk of the Barracks.
Diana, the receptionist, wordlessly handed him a slip of paper. He wasn’t
surprised to find the penalty for his lateness was guard duty at the front
gates of the Barracks.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Commander Wheally was sitting straight-backed behind
his desk when Ryan stepped into the open doorway. The man was aged, his
white hair almost gone, but he still looked rock hard under his scalemail
armor. He put down the report he was reading and looked up. “Come in, Wells,”
he said simply. Ryan stepped inside and stood at attention in front of
the desk. “Wells, it is not necessary to receive your new orders until
tomorrow morning.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally’s expression did not change. “Why were you
late to the briefing this morning?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I caught a cutpurse on my way back from night duty
and chased him down. After making the arrest it took longer than I thought
to return to the Barracks.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Keeping the Peace is a viable excuse, Wells.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan flushed. “It wasn’t keeping the Peace that made
me late, Sir. It was poor judgment. I should have run.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally nodded. “Close the door, Wells.” He waited
until Ryan had done so before continuing. “You are a good man, Wells. There
are not many officers who would not simply say they were keeping the Peace
and leave it at that. In fact, I think that you are Measure material. I
know that you are only a Notary Four now, but I can already see that you
have a bright future within the Harmonium ranks. If it had not been for
that incident in the Hive a few months back, you would have already completed
your fourth year. And as a Notary Five, you might have been promoted to
Measure One by now.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s swelling chest was deflated by the Mover’s
next statement. “That is why you have been assigned one of the Guvner observers.”
His distress must have been evident to Wheally, because the man’s voice
softened a fraction, if steel could be said to soften, as he went on. “This
business with the Fraternity of Order is a touchy one, Wells. We cannot
just assign any Hardhead to take care of one of these observers.” Ryan
was surprised to hear the Mover’s use of the street term for Harmonium
members. It was something that was generally looked down upon within the
faction’s ranks.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally picked up a well-worn book from the desktop.
Ryan recognized it instantly as the <i>Book of Harmonium</i>. “Every member
knows this book by heart and believes in it fully. And that is how it should
be. It promotes discipline and order. There are some who understand what
is said better than others though. A lot of delicate situations are going
to come up through this ‘exchange of ideas,’ as the Guvners call it, and
we need people who are going to keep their heads about them when it happens.
The only reason this thing went through in the Hall of Speakers is because
half of the other factions are just waiting for us to slip up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I think that you understand the meaning and intent
that the <i>Book of Harmonium</i> represents well enough not to get yourself
into trouble when one of those law-mongers pulls out a copy of the <i>Sigil
Municipal Code</i>. And I can assure you, they will.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded, understanding. The Harmonium, the Fraternity
of Order, and the Mercykillers made up the three branches of law enforcement
in Sigil: The Harmonium made the arrests, the Guvners conducted the trials,
and the Mercykillers carried out the punishment. Contrary to outward appearances
however, they did not actually work together. It would be more accurate
to say that they coexisted peacefully, each doing what they thought was
best. If the Guvners started stepping on toes and involving themselves
in the affairs of the other two factions, a myriad of problems could arise.
Most of them involved the Guvners getting seriously injured.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally continued. “I know the significance given
to assignment among Notaries and Measures. In fact I still have my own
chit bag from the times when I was assigned to regular patrols through
the Cage. I do not want you to think that this assignment is in any way
a reprimand. If anything, it is a vote of confidence. Factol Satin puzzled
over the assignments for days, and has selected each of you himself.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The softness left Wheally’s voice, and he was once
again all business. “I am placing you in command of Atorre, Siere, Wiles,
and Gracin. You are responsible for patrolling Scribe’s Way, Cannis Street,
Ferrit Street, and Alchemists’ Square. You will work in concert with Samon’s
and Claire’s patrols to handle Alchemists’ Square during the Festival of
Sensation. The woman coming from the Fraternity of Order is named Gina
Hawpress. She will meet you here tomorrow morning before you set out.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Perceiving that the meeting was over, Ryan turned
to go. Halfway through the door, he hesitated. Wheally had picked up the
report and resumed reading. “Yes, Wells?” he asked without looking up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How many chits did you have, Sir?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Goodbye Wells.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes Sir.” Ryan shut the door behind him.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">The next morning Ryan stood in the inner courtyard
of the Barracks. Arms crossed, he leaned against a brick wall and watched
a Mover bellowing at a group of trainees as they billeted back and forth
across the paved space. The commander yelled at a young woman. “You there!
Get back in line! If you want to take up the space of two people, you’d
damn well better be ready to take on twice the responsibility! All of you,
step lively!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s pride at being hand-picked by Factol Sarin
had been short-lived once he realized that the information had not been
widely circulated. The few conspiratorial winks he shared with the other
officers who had been assigned Guvner observers did little to outweigh
the many smirks he felt directed at his back.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A dingy grey cloud drifted overhead in the twilit
sky. Ryan shook away the expectation of sunrise. There was no sun in Sigil
to explain the regular lightening and darkening of the sky, no East or
West for it to travel. The city of Sigil existed alone on the inside of
a giant ring, its edges wrapped inward on themselves until the rest of
the multiverse was completely cut off. Nothing existed beyond the boundaries
of the city’s edge, which was why Sigil was often referred to as the Cage.
Ryan had grown up on a ‘normal’ world though, with a sun and two moons,
and old memories of his home died hard.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan did not know any of the officers assigned to
him personally, but he had heard nothing about them to make him think they
would be any trouble. It made sense once he thought about it. If the situation
was as volatile as Wheally had made it seem, they were most likely all
Notary Ones. Still serving their first year with the Harmonium, the lowest
ranking Notary Ones could be counted on to look to Ryan as their guide
for behavior. They would not be so completely hammered into the rigid forms
of Harmonium thought that they would react without thinking.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A delicate tap on his shoulder pulled Ryan from his
musings. Turning, he found himself looking down at a woman fully a foot
shorter than he was. Clear blue eyes squinted up at him through a thin
pair of silver-framed glasses. “Mister Wells?” she asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She held out her hand. “My name is Gina Hawpress.
I’ve been assigned as an adjunct to your position for observational and
advisory purposes.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Suddenly very conscious of his six foot height, Ryan
took the tiny hand in his own and shook it gently. The woman was barely
five feet tall and very slight. Her hair was a brilliant blue, hanging
straight down to her mid-back. She wore a light brown, ankle-length soft
leather jacket that seemed to be made solely out of pockets sewn together
inside and out, even down the sleeves. It was open to reveal a spotless
white tunic securely tucked into a belted pair of dark leather breeches.
Her black shoes were well polished, and their brass buckles gleamed even
in the dim early morning light. Over her shoulder was a strap connected
to a pack that bulged in distinctive rectangular outlines, telling Ryan
that she had indeed brought along a copy of the <i>Sigil Municipal Code</i>,
along with several other books.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Miss, Hawpress,” Ryan greeted her stiffly. He had
not missed the addition of the title ‘advisor,’ or its implications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’m sorry for seeking you out like this, but I wanted
to have a chance to talk to you before we set out on the street. I understand
that many members of the Harmonium faction might see this as a threat to
their authority and I want to assure you that this is not the case. The
purpose of my presence as a member of your patrol is not to dictate to
you the precepts of the Law, but to observe and learn what kind of methods
you employ in carrying out its enforcement.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Miss Hawpress, you are <i>not</i> a member of my
patrol.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina sniffed. “Of course not officially so. I only
meant after a fashion. I won’t be participating in the actual arrests,
merely present to observe them.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded vaguely. “Let’s go, Miss Hawpress. My
men are waiting.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">After a brief delay at the front desk, where Gina
returned her visitor’s pass and signed out with Diana, they emerged into
the street. Ryan instinctively settled into an easy, energy-saving gait
that would serve him all day without making him too tired for a fight.
Gina, her legs moving quickly to keep up, took a small lead pencil and
a notebook from one of her many pockets and started scribbling. Ryan rolled
his eyes and increased his speed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The dirty city streets were frequented by few pedestrians,
and they reached Alchemists’ Square quickly. The square was a large promenade,
four hundred feet on a side tiled in large squares of dark grey slate.
In the very center was a fountain of black marble which sprayed water into
the air in glistening fans.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The square’s name originated in a time before the
factions, when Sigil had been run primarily by guilds. The Alchemists’
Guild had been small but powerful. Centered in what was then known as the
Alchemists’ Quarter, they built up a monopoly of secrets and formulae that
made them wealthy, while their skill with chemicals and poisons made them
deadly enemies. Eventually they set their sights higher though, seeking
the recipe for an elixir which would transform them into gods.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">One god with their temperament would have been bad
enough, but an entire cadre of gods was something unheard of. They would
have been an incredible force in any case, let alone finding themselves
in Sigil, the center of the universe. One night an explosion rocked the
whole Cage as the Alchemists’ Quarter was incinerated from within. No bodies
had ever been found in the wreckage, and the chant had it that the Lady
of Pain had mazed the entire guild, banishing them to an extradimensional
‘pocket’ plane of existence forever. Most believed that in order to ensure
that nothing of their work survived, the Lady chose a crucial moment in
their experiments, causing the explosion.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Afterwards, the Dabus cleared out the wreckage, which
by then was little more than ashes and unrecognizable debris, and completely
paved over the entire area, creating the square. No one knew where the
water of the fountain came from or went to, and most thought that it was
a bizarre result of the Alchemists’ experiments and the Dabus had built
the fountain up around it. In any case, the water it poured forth was always
clear and pure, though it was not advisable to drink from the basin, since
many found it an easy way to dispose of undesirable liquids.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan and Gina found the other Harmonium patrol members
at a corner, watching the square’s activity impassively. The three men
and one woman were huge, each one at least six inches taller than Ryan.
It was obvious by the way they held themselves that they were Notary Ones.
Accustomed to the restrictive weight of their armor, but not so used to
it that it was like a second skin, as it was with Ryan. Rumor had it that
Sarin wore his for days at a time without noticing, even sleeping in it.
Ryan had heard that one of the man’s children had found him not wearing
the distinctive red steel platemail, and had run away screaming that a
stranger had broken into their rooms. The large individuals were wise choices
for the patrol as well. Eighty percent of preventing trouble in a crowd
control situation meant standing still and intimidating people into behaving.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina looked up at the giants with wide eyes. Only
an instant passed however, before her back straightened and she bravely
introduced herself to the Harmonium towering over her. It was evident to
Ryan by their unfriendly glares that they had not been party to the importance
of this assignment.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Once the introductions were finished, Ryan quickly
outlined their patrol routes, splitting the group into two parties. Wiles
joined he and Gina, while Siere, Gracen and Atorre made up the second group.
Ryan waited with his patrol as the second group set out. After ten minutes
had passed they would walk down the street as well, following the same
route. It would ensure that they were each within running distance of each
other, while allowing them to cover the maximum amount of ground.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Feeling the right amount of time had passed, Ryan
assumed the blank, impassive face of patrol and set out, Gina and Wiles
following a step behind.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<p><font face="Arial">The day was predictably dull. In addition to the
Civic Festhall, the Clerk’s Ward was the location of the Hall of Records,
a great building where documents of ownership and taxes were housed, and
the Hall of Speakers, where all the factions of the city met to argue about
law and policy within Sigil. Second only to the Lady’s Ward, which contained
the Barracks and the rest of Sigil’s law enforcement, the Clerk’s Ward
was a source of little trouble. The lack of activity was emphasized by
the way Gina peppered him with tiresome questions as they walked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“At what point do you authorize the use of force?
What about lethal force? If a man is stabbed, do you pursue the culprit
or stay to help the man? How do you deal with violations of the Codes of
Conduct? What is prescribed in a hostage situation? Do you have a jurisdiction?
What are its limits? What warrants a warning as opposed to an arrest? Have
you ever had a problem with the apparent conflict between general conduct
code eight and the seventeenth sub-clause to clause forty-two of the Civil
Liberty laws?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nearly let out a sigh of relief when an inhuman
screech went up two blocks away on Scribe’s Way. It was followed by the
sound of shattering glass and several more human-sounding screams. Before
the sound ended, Ryan and Wiles had broken into a run, quickly outdistancing
Gina. They arrived at a small, single story establishment Ryan recognized
as a spell shop. The front window had been shattered and broken glass lay
everywhere on the stone street. Upon the arrival of the two Harmonium officers,
several innocent spectators appeared, replacing the prospective looters
who had been greedily eyeing the unguarded window a moment before.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The wooden sign hanging above the door was painted
with several pictures, indicating the store’s products. A mortar and pestle,
a leaf, and a blue star declared that the proprietor sold things which
had to do with chemicals, herbs and plants, and spells. Below the pictures,
words in gold lettering said,</font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial">Zertich’s Arcane Apothecary</font>
<br><font face="Arial">Dealer in Services Alchemical, Herbal, and Magical</font></center>

<p><font face="Arial">His hand on the sword at his belt, Wiles quickly
encouraged the crowd of spectators to go about their business while taking
aside those who had actually seen what had happened. Ryan tried the front
door of the shop and found it locked. He was about to kick it in when Gina
suddenly appeared, breathing heavily. “Wait!” she shouted. “That’s contaminating
the evidence! We have to note everything as it is now.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Wiles,” Ryan called to the man.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Sir?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Note that we found the door locked.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan kicked the door. The wood buckled and the lock
snapped, sending the door inward to crash against the inner wall. Ignoring
Gina’s shocked stammer, he stepped into the darkened interior of the shop.
Shelves filled with bottles and jars lined the walls, covering every vertical
surface. A long waist-high counter blocked off the rear twenty feet of
the room. Occupying the back area were two wide tables, side by side. Each
was covered with shattered glass and spilt chemicals. Parchment lay strewn
about everywhere.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It was deathly quiet inside, the bustle of the city
outside softened to a distant roar. Ryan was familiar with this silence.
It was the silence that always followed especially serious crimes. A shocked
silence of confusion and attempting to understand what had happened. The
Peace had been disturbed, the orderly flow of the universe broken.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mister Wells!” Gina said angrily from the doorway
behind him. “This is destruction of personal property and trespassing…”
She trailed off as she became aware of the oppressive lack of sound.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan drew his long sword and strode forward, vaulting
over the counter. Several of the spilt chemicals were giving off noxious
fumes and Ryan breathed shallowly, trying to inhale as little of the strange
odors as possible. Tiny green sparks raced across the floor as the strange
liquids combined. Careful to avoid stepping in any of them, he made his
way to the dark silhouette of a doorway in the back wall.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Leaping through the doorway, he shouted, “Harmonium!
Don’t move!” Nearly slipping, he barely caught his balance on the slick
floor. Seeing what the liquid was, and its source, he sighed and put his
sword back into its scabbard.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Wiles!” he called, stepping back into the outer
room. “We’ve got a body!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina still stood at the threshold of the front door.
“What do you mean a body? A dead body? Are you saying someone’s been murdered?”
Ryan found a section of the counter which was hinged to swing up and allow
passage to the front of the shop. He used it and continued toward Gina.
“What’s that on your boots? Is that blood?” The woman looked slightly green.
She quickly backed out of his way as Ryan exited the shop. He looked expectantly
at Wiles, who was standing next to a group of people.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Seven eye-witnesses, Sir,” the man said. “Two say
it was a Baatezu, three say it was an invisible monster, and two more say
it was a young man.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded, thinking. “What about the two who said
it was a Baatezu?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wiles understood the question. “Husband and wife,
Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“All right. I want to talk to the three who saw the
invisible monster.” He paused and rethought the statement. “I want to talk
to the three that say it was an invisible monster. Let the rest go.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mister Wells,” a much paler Gina joined them. “Those
are eye-witnesses you’re turning away. We need to take down all of their
statements.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan grinned. “All right Miss Hawpress. If you think
it’s important, you can interview them.” Wiles was making a brave attempt
to hide his own smile.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">After speaking with the witnesses, Ryan reconvened
with Wiles. The other patrol was in sight by that time, hurrying down the
street. “Head for the Barracks,” he told Wiles. “Tell Wheally what happened.
I think Zertich summoned up something that got away from him. Nothing human
did that to him in there, and there’s a good amount of random destruction
as well.” Wiles nodded and immediately struck out in the direction of the
Barracks.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina looked as if she had finished and was walking
towards Ryan. It was obvious she was upset. “How can you hope to ever get
anything coherent from these people?” she fumed. “Four supposed eye-witnesses,
and yet four different stories!” She shook a handful of notes. “The man
and woman who said they saw a Baatezu couldn’t even agree on what color
it was. They changed their descriptions in mid-sentence! At least the two
who said they saw a young man gave accurate descriptions, but they were
of two completely different men!” She threw up her hands in frustration.
“What did you get from those three that saw the invisible creature?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“They each said that they heard a horrible screech,
and a moment later the window shattered as if something huge had smashed
it. But none of them saw what it was.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Gods! That’s even more useless that the others.”
She made a visible effort to calm herself. “Okay, what do we do now?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked up at the darkening sky. The lights of
the buildings on the other side of the great ring that made up Sigil were
already peeking through the intervening air like dim stars. The second
group had boarded up the smashed window and broken door and were awaiting
orders. “Our shift is over. We’ll go on patrol again tomorrow and try to
get in touch with Zertich’s friends and family to find out what he was
working on. The night patrol will make sure nothing is disturbed here.”
He looked at the others. “Keep your eyes and ears open for anything that
has to do with attacks by an invisible monster.” They nodded. “All right,
I’ll see you men tomorrow.” He turned and began walking in the direction
of the Lady’s Ward.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It took Gina a moment to recover from her shock and
catch up with him. “Wait a second! You actually believe the people who
didn’t see anything?” Ryan quickened his step, not looking down at her.
“Yes.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina did not relent however. “Will you tell me why?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Their story is corroborated by all the evidence
and there’s more of them.” To Ryan’s relief, the small woman was quiet
for the remainder of the walk back to the Barracks. She left Ryan with
a short farewell and an ominous promise to meet him again tomorrow morning.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally was ready for him when he entered the office.
“Have you learned anything new?” he asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shook his head. “Witnesses heard a horrible
shriek and something invisible burst out of the front window. It’s all
we could get.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally sighed. “Whatever it was is running loose
in Sigil now, and I don’t think we can rely on the hope that it will just
unsummon itself See if you can get in touch with some of Zertich’s acquaintances
tomorrow and find out what he was working on and whether or not it will
continue to disrupt the Peace. With any luck, it’s just one more irate
planar fiend that wasn’t too happy about being yanked from its home plane.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The old officer glanced at a thick packet of papers
that Ryan recognized as the agreement between the Harmonium and the Guvners.
“How is it going with the ‘observer?’”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan grimaced. “Not well, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You’re doing better than most. As of today, three
of the Guvners are not on speaking terms with the Harmonium patrols they
were assigned to. Luckily enough, no fights have broken out yet, but that
is not going to last. The only advice I can give you is not to get into
an argument with her. Those damned Guvners are too thickheaded to see that
we are right, and too good at debating to be convinced otherwise short
of hitting them over the head with a club. Stick to keeping the Peace.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded, calling to mind a passage from the <i>Book
of Harmonium</i>.</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial">‘Just because someone knows more and can
speak better than you doesn’t mean that they’re right. Knowledge is dangerous.
Some of the greatest conflicts and chaos have been spawned by searching
for knowledge instead of Peace. And sometimes in the search for Peace,
it is necessary for knowledge to be sacrificed.’</font></blockquote>

<hr SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="50%">
<p><font face="Arial">Much to his dismay, Ryan found Gina waiting for him
outside the Barracks main entrance the next morning. She wore a determined
look on her face, and held the same book of notes in her hand she had been
scribbling in the day before. It looked much thicker. “Mr. Wells,” she
said in greeting.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Good morning, Miss Hawpress.” Ryan passed her without
slowing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She skipped and fell into step beside him. “You knew
that those witnesses’ stories would not be valid,” she accused. “I reviewed
the facts last night and came to the same conclusion you did. But you knew
without even interviewing them. How?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan had to concentrate for a moment before he spoke,
trying to put into words what had become instinct to him. “Those berks
that said it was a man were obviously lying. It wasn’t a man that made
that noise we heard, and it wasn’t a man that killed Zertich. Besides,
a man who had just killed someone wouldn’t scream and leap through a window
into a street full of people. He’d use the door and try to remain unnoticed.
Those two probably both described men they had grudges against and wouldn’t
mind seeing arrested. I’ll bet they told you exactly where you could find
the culprit too.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina’s irritated grimace was answer enough. “What
about the couple who saw the Baatezu?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“They were close to each other. Likely, they discussed
what they witnessed and collaborated. That means that their story counts
as just one account, making it one against three. It’s more likely that
the three accounts which agree both with the evidence and with each other
are true.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina was silent until they reached the Alchemists’
Square once again. Ryan assigned duties, ordering Atorre to accompany him
back to Zertich’s shop. The others were sent on the regular patrol route.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Once they reached the shop, Ryan pried off the boards
which had been nailed over the door and stepped inside. The room lay in
much the same state that they had left it in. Several dark stains now replaced
the puddles of chemicals, and in one case a large portion of the wooden
floor had been eaten away, exposing dark stone beneath.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What are we doing here?” Gina asked, surveying the
destruction with a disapproving eye.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“All the evidence suggests that Zertich summoned
something that got away from him. We’re here to find out if it’s something
that could further threaten the Peace, or just one more fiend walking the
streets. Keep an eye out for anything with names on it that could lead
us to a friend or business relation who could tell us what he was working
on.” Ryan walked across the room to the back room once again.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Inside the small room the odor of decay was heavy,
and the wizard’s body still decorated various areas of the floor. Ignoring
the smell, Ryan surveyed the space. It was a typical wizard’s laboratory
as far as he was concerned. Chalk outlines and diagrams crisscrossed the
floor, and parchment containing schematics and unintelligible writings
covered the walls. A glimmer caught his eye from the floor and he reached
down to pick up a pair of glasses. The lenses were shattered and the frame
bent beyond repair.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mr. Wells, I think you should look at- ugh!” Gina
broke off as she stepped into the room, covering her nose and mouth with
her hand. She avoided looking at the carnage on the floor and focused her
eyes firmly on Ryan as she continued. “You should see something out here,”
she said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan dropped the ruined spectacles and followed her
to the path of destruction that led through the front of the store. She
gestured at the mess. “This scene does not fit any pattern that would coincide
with an enraged fiend escaping its summoner. The dispersal pattern of both
the glass fragments and the contents of the containers suggest that whatever
caused this destruction was moving inward, not outward”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan stared at her blankly for a moment as his brain
struggled to extract meaning from her statement. Finally he centered on
the words ‘inward, not outward,’ and looked again at the destruction. Most
of the glass from the front window lay on the floor inside the shop. Although
a few bottles looked as if they had been smashed against the side walls,
the rest looked to have been thrown against the back wall. What had once
been contents of the two tables now occupied the floor farthest from the
front window, as if they had been swept off in that direction. Whatever
had smashed its way through the shop had come from the street and headed
inward toward Zertich, not outward away from him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Atorre picked up a handful of documents from the
floor and said, “Here, Sir. Inventory lists and receipts from suppliers.”
Before Ryan could take them, Gina intercepted the man and accepted the
papers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan watched in amazement as the woman scanned through
the lists and tables with unbelievable speed. After each sheet was finished
it was placed in a neat stack on the table next to her. In less than a
minute, she had gone through a pile of at least thirty pages. “Most of
these entries are purchases,” she said after putting down the last sheet.
“There are two names which appear repeatedly and record deliveries both
sent and received. Annli Webspinner, and Thropal Corvex.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I know of Annli Webspinner,” Ryan said after a moment.
“She’s in charge of registration and faction activities at the Civic Festhall.
The Harmonium have been in close contact with her in order to make preparations
for the festival.”</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">The Civic Festhall was a grand affair by the standards
of nearly every race that had ever encountered it. Only a visiting group
of Kllckjrrrggrl from an unknown prime world had not been impressed. Several
dissenters of the Sensates declared that this was proof that they had wasted
the near-century of construction time trying to build a structure that
would tantalize the senses of all. Although any member of the Society of
Sensation would be quick to tell them that it wasn’t faulty design that
had produced the lack of interest, but the fact that Kllckjrrrggrl had
no eyes, ears, noses, or tongues and couldn’t feel anything fainter than
slamming into a stone wall, which they did often.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Even the rigid, order-loving Harmonium had to admit
that the structure was a marvel of craftsmanship. Most, like Ryan, found
it far too distracting and frivolous as he mounted the steps and entered
through the vaulted doors into the main hall. There was always something
catching the eye or teasing the ears. A cunning bit of illusionary artwork
on the wall, or whispered music filtering down from the vaulted ceilings.
It was hard to keep one’s mind on the Peace.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli Webspinner was a bauriur, a centaur-like race
which had more in common with rams and goats than horses. They found her
standing behind a large, semi-circular desk in the center of the central
hall of the Civic Festhall. She wore a long-sleeved, black silk shirt which
perfectly matched the long black hair of her flanks. Squinting through
a pair of glasses which reminded Ryan far too much of Gina, she asked,
“What can I do for you?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What can you tell me about a wizard named Zertich?”
Ryan asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The friendly welcoming expression on Annli’s face
was quickly replaced by one of guarded caution. “Very little. Why? What’s
happened?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’m afraid he’s been murdered. I believe that he
summoned a creature that he could not control and it attacked and killed
him. Do you know what he was working on?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Zertich wasn’t working on any-” she stopped short.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan pressed her. “Yes? Go on, Miss Webspinner.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Zertich didn’t summon things. He looked at things.
He was a Diviner.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Do you know what he was working on?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She hesitated before answering. “No.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded briskly. “Very well. Atorre, arrest Miss
Webspinner.” Atorre nodded and took a pair of shackles from his belt.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What?!” both Gina and Annli cried out at the same
time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It’s against the law to lie to an officer of the
Harmonium. Punishable by up to a week in the Prison.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the following verbal assault, Ryan had trouble
separating what Gina and Annli each said, the two tirades reaching his
ears in a jumble of words. “You can’t do that! I have too much planning
to do for the festival… must be officially proved to be lying either by
a Truth or Detect Lie spell cast by... traders and merchants to deal with,
official guests to greet and... incarcerate for a day at most before interrogation
by a duly authorized… melon sculptor coming all the way from... Section
12 of the Guerretia Agreement, clauses four through thirteen!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Through it all, Atorre continued to advance on the
bariaur. He was inches away from clamping the shackles around her wrists
before she finally gave in. “All right, all right! I’ll tell you. Just
get him away from me!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Waiting until Atorre had retreated and once again
affixed the shackles firmly to his belt, she stepped out from behind the
desk. “Follow me,” she said, trotting back across the Main Hall to the
far end.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Against the far wall was a small raised dais, upon
which sat an empty throne. The gilded seat was a remnant from days long
ago, when the Society of Sensation’s hierarchy had been slightly different.
Now, although the Factol was never seen to have sat in the throne, it was
widely believed that it was only because Erin Montgomery, one of the most
powerful and influential beings in Sigil, didn’t need to. On either side
of the dais was a simple, unimposing door.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli approached the left door and knocked softly
on the dark wood. A muffled voice said something from within. “Wait here,”
she told them as she opened the door and entered. A moment later she reappeared,
gesturing for them to come in.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan motioned silently for Atorre to wait outside
as he and Gina stepped through the open door. Several swords decorated
the walls of the small room, interspersed with paintings and other hanging
decorations. Thick red carpet covered the floor, upon which were three
cushioned chairs and a pale wooden desk. Reclining in a leather chair behind
the desk, beneath a large rendition of the Society of Sensation’s insignia,
was Erin Montgomery, Factol of the Sensates.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s heart leapt into his throat at the sight of
the beautiful woman. Emerald green eyes gazed intently at him from a delicate
face, framed by short, auburn hair. He swallowed hard. “Factol Montgomery,”
he said in greeting. She nodded in acknowledgement. “Officer Wells and
Miss Hawpress. I understand that you have some questions about one of our
members?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, Factol,” Gina said. “I’m afraid that the wizard
known as Zertich has been murdered. We understand that he had quite a few
business dealings with Miss Webspinner.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That is true,” Erin said. “Annli and Zertich have
been working quite closely these past few months in preparation for the
festival. Zertich was going to provide us with out main event.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What exactly,” Ryan asked. “Was Zertich working
on?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">At a nod from Erin, Annli stepped forward. “About
a year ago, Zertich approached me, saying that he had something that no
one had ever experienced before, something completely and wholly new. He
said that he would guarantee that no one in the Society of Sensation would
have ever seen anything like it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I was skeptical at first, of course. I can’t tell
you how many times new members have run in and told me that they’d just
experienced something never heard of before, only to find a Memory Stone
containing an experience almost exactly the same.” Erin placed a jeweled
box, about a foot wide and six inches on a side, on her desk and opened
it. From its interior she withdrew a glittering stone sphere the size of
her fist. “Zertich told the truth though,” she said. “And he gave us this
to prove it.” A flick of her wrist sent it flying towards Ryan, who instinctively
caught it. “Use it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked at the small sphere in his hand distrustfully.
It felt heavier than it looked. He had used one of the stones only once
before, in order to view the home world of the Harmonium in all its orderly
and peaceful glory. Recalling how to use it, Ryan cleared his mind and
focused all his attention on the stone. It grew warm in his hand for a
moment before the sensation overtook him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He was standing in the back room of Zertich’s shop
again. The mess of smudged chalk diagrams and littered chemicals remained.
All that seemed different was the lack of Zertich’s grisly corpse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A hand that was not Ryan’s moved in a complicated
gesture, while an unfamiliar voice chanted mysterious syllables. As the
Memory Stone fully asserted itself, the hand became his hand, the voice
his voice. There was tension gathering in the air, shaping itself around
his hand. As the incantation ended, he pointed down to the floor. There,
in a small area of floor unmarked by the rampant chalked runes that filled
most of the surface, was a single circular piece of glass, perhaps an inch
and a half in diameter. Ryan felt the tension travel away from his hand
and into the thin glass circle. That finished, he reached down and picked
it up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Holding it up to his face, Ryan closed his left eye
and looked through the lens with his right. He was astonished at what he
saw. The small corner of his mind which was not immersed in the experience
let out a low whistle. No wonder Annli had been slow to reveal any information
about this. He doubted seriously that anyone at the festival would be able
to say they’d seen the like before.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He could still see the room and its contents, but
it was as if space had been added to everything. Highlighted in colors
he did not recognize, Ryan could see through the wall into the alley beyond.
Rats scurried under the floor boards shining with strange luminescence.
Candle flames burned in lamps that were surely in buildings which placed
half a dozen layers of wood and stone between them, and punctuating it
all were flashes of strange brightness from unknown sources that seemed
miles away.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan lifted his free hand and was astonished to see,
in addition to its pale, fleshy exterior, the shadowy forms of bones and
muscle within. Holding it close, he found he could see veins, pumping blood
back and forth from his heart to the tips of his fingers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Slowly, the vision faded and the experience ended.
Ryan looked up at Erin in astonishment, half expecting to be able to see
through her as well. In the aftermath of the experience, Ryan felt close
to blind. “What was that?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli took the stone back and gave it to Erin, who
placed it back in the box before speaking. “I assume you know the founding
belief of the Society of Sensation. We believe that in order to understand
the universe, we must experience as much of it as possible. We all seek
out new experiences in order to bring ourselves closer to that understanding.
It only stands to reason that this becomes harder the more one experiences.
As time passes, we find ourselves traveling great distances for new experiences.
A few are content with exploring the nuances of life, but most search for
greater and greater extremes. Zertich was the first to take this idea in
a... new direction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Many Sensates find that after years of concentrating
so hard on the input of our senses, we become more highly attuned. Able
to hear better, more distinctly. Taste buds picking out every ingredient
of a food and judging the bouquet of each individually. Zertich was intrigued
with this idea. I could even go so far as to say he was obsessed by it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“He studied every spell he could get his hands on
that enhanced the senses, focusing primarily on those involving sight.
Each one he found to be insufficient for what he sought. So he started
experimenting with expanding his senses using spells of his own creation.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina spoke up. “What was insufficient about them?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Do you know of the spells which grant infravision?”
Gina nodded. “Then you understand how it works.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It enchants your eyes so you can ‘see’ heat. It’s
very useful for seeing people in the dark.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes and no," Erin said. “The infravision spell you
are familiar with performs that way, after a fashion. You see, humans cannot
see in the infrared range of vision. Some creatures can, but most cannot.
The spell which you speak of ‘translates’ heat into something you can see.
Cast the spell and suddenly bodies are giving off light in a mixture of
oranges and yellows. Flames are green and white, cold stone is blue and
black. But the spell doesn’t make it so you can actually see heat. It makes
it so the heat can be seen by you. If we really could, really could see
heat, it wouldn’t look blue, or red, or orange. It would have whole new
colors.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan said, “I saw colors I couldn’t recognize when
I used the stone. Were they-?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes. You were seeing heat, actually seeing it, in
addition to various other emanations.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You said that he gave that to you over a year ago?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes. According to Zertich, he had expanded and refined
his research since then, exploring realms of sight we never knew existed.
It was going to be the main event of the festival. We had planned to enchant
several memory stones so that they could be activated all at once and utilized
by the entire crowd. An entirely new sensation. Something that nobody had
ever experienced before.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’m sorry Factol Montgomery, but it looks like you’re
going to need a new main event now. I have one more question to ask. Do
you know who Thorpal Corvex is?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes,” Annli said. “He works at the Foundry. Zertich
dealt with him for most of his materials.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We should take the Memory Stone as well,” Gina suggested.
“For evidence.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin, Annli, and Ryan all shook their heads simultaneously.
Erin said, “It won’t be any use to you. Once a memory stone leaves the
confines of the Civic Festhall, it becomes inert.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How were you going to make these stones available
to the public? The festival usually takes up the whole of Alchemists’ Square.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli looked uncomfortable at the question, but Erin
answered coolly. “There are ways to extend the range of the stones for
a limited time. It’s not something we wish to advertise though.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan nodded his assent to the indirect request for
secrecy. “Thank you for your cooperation, Factol. Miss Webspinner. We can
see our own way out.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli’s voice followed them out the door into the
hall. “I hope you find whoever did it, Officer Wells. Zertich was a friend
of mine.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Inside the office, Erin carefully closed the lid
on the two spheres glittering within the jeweled box.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">“Well that’s just wonderful,” Gina said as the three
of them exited the Festhall. “Now we have no idea what killed Zertich.
If it was some invisible monster, he certainly didn’t summon it.” She crossed
out several entries in her notebook.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan stood at the top of the ivory stairway just
outside the great doors, looking out into the street. “He still might have
summoned it. His search for expansion of the senses may have led him to
deal with fiends or other monsters.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That’s impossible.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Just because he was a wizard doesn’t mean that he
was above reproach-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“No, I mean that if he were a Diviner Wizard, then
it’s impossible that he would know any summoning spells. Summoning spells
occupy a completely different area of magical study from Divination. They’re
so dissimilar from each other that any research of Summoning spells would
entirely conflict with his work in Divination.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How do you know all that?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I know a lot about magic, and it has rules just
like anything else. Even more so, since breaking those rules can often
mean losing your head.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You can lose your head breaking other rules too.
So you’re a wizard then?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Of course not,” Gina scoffed. “I’m a scholar. Magic
is just a hobby that I pursue in my spare time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan rolled his eyes. “Right. My mistake.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“So now what? Do we go find Corvex?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“No. It’s off our patrol route. Tonight I’ll talk
to Commander Wheally and get a couple more men to take this route tomorrow
so we can follow up. Don’t worry, we’ll be back with you the day after.
Hopefully with all of this sorted out.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina spun around. “Wait, you don’t think I’m going
to stay here, do you? After all this, I want to see this investigation
through to the end.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shook his head. “That’s out of the question,
Miss Hawpress. One of the conditions Factol Sarin agreed to was that you
would be out of harm’s way for this little combined effort. The rules are
clear.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina’s face hardened, and Ryan instantly knew he
had said the wrong thing. “Oh, it’s rules is it? The man who has no regard
for personal property, who arrests without due cause wants to follow the
rules? Let me tell you something, Mister Wells,” she said, eyes flashing.
“I deal with people like you all the time at the Courts. People who think
that the Law is only there to obey when it’s convenient. Dozens of beings
who stamp in and demand that justice be done, that they’ve been grievously
wronged. And when we investigate, we find that they’re just as bad, if
not worse, than the very people they complain about!</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It doesn’t work that way. And if you think it does,
then you’re sorely mistaken. Rules are not something you can pick up and
put down at your leisure. The multiverse runs and operates by rules, and
if you continue on as you have been, one of these days you’re going to
ignore the wrong rule and find yourself pitted against the planes themselves!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“If it comes to that, I won’t be alone,” Ryan said
ominously.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What’s that supposed to mean?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It means,” Atorre said. “That he’ll have the whole
of the Harmonium backing him up. Commander Wells wouldn’t do anything that
went against what we believe, and if the planes have a problem with what
he believes, then it’s got a problem with what we all believe.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina glared at him scathingly. “You’d take on the
entire multiverse?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan realized that his hand had found its way to
a sword hilt. He forced it to let go. “We already have. That’s the way
it’s been from the beginning. The universe is a violent, unlawful, chaotic
place. It needs someone like us.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You’re going to tell the universe how it should
be? And you expect it to listen to you? Sit up and beg? Roll over?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes. Whether it wants to or not.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“And what if it can't? What if the very way the universe
is put together means that your brand of order simply doesn’t work?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“The Universe is what you make it, Miss Hawpress.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina flung her arms out, gesturing to the streets
and buildings. “Look around you Mister Wells! The universe has already
been made. You can take a steel door, melt it down, pound it out, and make
it into the ugliest sculpture in the world. It won’t change the fact that
it’s steel.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan stepped closer to the smaller woman, looming
threateningly. “We’re not out to make anything new. We just want to hammer
out the dents and scrape off the rust. In the end, it’ll be a better door
for it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“With all the hammering you’re doing, you’re more
likely to shatter it than fix it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Anything that’s broken is better off that way. We
won’t need it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She let out a short, humorless laugh. “So you’re
willing to rip apart the foundations of reality if need be?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We’ll build new foundations. Stronger ones.” Ryan
towered over Gina now, so close they were almost touching. “We’re late
for our patrol, Miss Hawpress.” Before she could reply, he turned his back
on her and resolutely stormed down the stairs of the Civic Festhall. His
fists were clenched tightly at his sides.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">What remained of the day passed like an eternity.
For the first time in years Ryan longed for his home world. He missed the
passage of the sun to mark time passing. The gradual darkening of Sigil’s
grey, sunless skies made the hours pass even more slowly without any way
to tell exactly what time it was. He could have asked Gina the time. She
must have carried a pocket watch, all Guvners did. But it would have been
impossible to be heard over her steady stream of words without shouting.
It was only by a narrow margin that Ryan kept his anger in check, and only
strict obedience that kept Atorre from letting loose.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It made Ryan long for yesterday, when Gina’s interest
in him was merely academic. Now though, she asked questions like a weapons
master wielded a sword. She attacked, feinted, dodged and parried with
incredible skill. She asked seemingly innocent questions and then pounced
on the answer as if it were a fatal flaw in his defense. Above all, she
asked questions that made him angry.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What is your reaction to verbal abuse? What if it’s
against your Harmonium? That’s certainly too harsh, don’t you think? How
many injuries have you caused in your service to the peace? What were the
circumstances? Were you involved in that fiasco some years ago when an
entire layer of Arcadia slipped into Mechanus? Do you have any witnesses
to that? Do you have any reliable witnesses? What were you thinking when
you kicked in that door at Zerich’s? Did it feel good, destroying someone
else’s property, bought by hard-earned money? Do you think you’re better
than common man just because you wear the badge of the Harmonium?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Eons later, when they finally reached the Barracks,
Ryan did not slow as he approached. He stormed into the halls, pushing
past other officers. Gina’s voice drifted shrilly in from the street. “And
don’t think you can just pass me off like some second-hand hat! I’ll be
waiting for you tomorrow morning!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s strained and frayed temper finally snapped.
In a haze of rage, he lashed out, aiming his fist at the wall. He had expected
to strike stone, but was surprised to hit wood. Wood that shattered under
the force of his blow. What had once been a door was torn from its hinges
and fell inward to the floor in pieces.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Commander Wheally looked up from what he was writing.
“Ah, Mr. Wells. I assume you’re here to give your report.” He drove his
quill home into an inkpot and waited expectantly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Er, yes Sir.” Ryan said lamely, nursing his bruised
knuckles. He stepped over the mangled wood into the office and cleared
his throat embarrassedly. “We’ve eliminated for the most part the possibility
that Zertich had summoned up whatever killed him, though I’m not ruling
it out. I’d like to investigate further by going down to the Foundry tomorrow.
Zertich had dealings there with a man named Thorpal Corvex.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Any idea what the culprit is yet?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan sighed and shook his head. “No, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“And how are things with Miss Hawpress progressing?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You don’t want to know, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Just by observing the fact that my door is not Miss
Hawpress, I will assume that <i>she</i> is not in similar condition.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Unfortunately not, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, we’ve had similar reports from the rest of
the patrols. And more than innocent doors have suffered for it. There haven’t
been any serious injuries, but we’ve lost three of our observers to these
‘differences of opinion.’ I can’t imagine their reports will reflect favorably
on their observations.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Is there any way I could convince Miss Hawpress
to leave for similar reasons?” Ryan asked sullenly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally stood abruptly. Although Ryan remained at
attention, inwardly he shrank away from the fury in the man’s steely glare.
“This is not a joking matter, Mr. Wells! Do you know what happened when
the Harmonium first discovered other worlds and entire planes of existence
beyond its own home world?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan knew the story. Every Harmonium member did.
“Yes, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That is right. They saw universe of chaos and disorder.
They already had an entire world pacified and under control, so how much
trouble could the rest of existence be? We sent an entire army into the
first layer of the Abyss, to spread a little peace and stability. They
were slaughtered, Mr. Wells. Barely a platoon made it back through the
portal to tell us what happened.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Since then, we have changed tactics. We have a presence
in Sigil, and through the City of Doors, we have gained footholds on dozens
of worlds and have even expanded into the Outer Planes.” Wheally circled
his desk and stood directly in front of Ryan. “What, Mr. Wells, is the
moral of the story?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan answered immediately. “That a club is not always
the most effective weapon. Sometimes a dagger can find the space between
armored plates when a club would do no damage. Sometimes a weapon is not
necessary at all. Above all, one should know what and where one is attacking.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally nodded severely. “I would be appalled if
you could not have recalled that passage from the <i>Book of Harmonium</i>.
Let me tell you what and where we are attacking. We are attacking the multiverse,
and we are attacking it here, in Sigil. Sigil is an outpost where we can
look out into the rest of the planes of existence. It is a beachhead that
allows us to marshal our forces and spread out across reality.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We have gained much, but do not fool yourself Mr.
Wells. Sigil is a cross-section of the rest of the multiverse, and it will
be a long time before we have taken enough of the multiverse to think about
taking the Cage.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It is imperative that we do not wield a club in
this battle. That is because this is a battle we will lose. The Doomguard
control the Armory, the Mercykillers hold the Prison, and the Guvners run
the Courts. At the moment our power and influence in Sigil is limited.
So we serve the Peace by enforcing the law here, and we use the city as
a bridge to the rest of the planes.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“If the Fraternity of Order tries to move in on our
jurisdiction, which they may very well be intending to do, we will give
then a damn good fight but in the end, we will lose the most important
outpost we have in this war. So above all, don’t give them a reason to!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan straightened. “Yes Sir!”</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">The next morning, Ryan opened the door to Wheally’s
office. Until recently, it had been the door to his own room. Filling the
entrance to his room was now a half-shattered slab of wood which hung dangerously
askew on bent hinges. “You wanted to see me, Sir?” The requisition for
a new door would not likely be answered for at least a week.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, Mr. Wells. Early this morning I was delivered
this packet.” The commander held up a stack of paper half an inch thick.
“It is the agreement the Harmonium entered into with the Fraternity of
Order for this observer ordeal. Several sections have been underlined,
particularly those involving ongoing investigations.” He turned to a marked
page and read aloud, “‘Afore mentioned observers are to observe the actions
and doings of specific patrols and individuals in order to help understand
the decision making process and procedures followed by those individuals.
Hence, observers must remain with those who they are assigned to observe.
In the event of the death of the subject of observation, the observer is
expected to be assigned to those officers investigating the death of the
subject...’ etcetera, etcetera.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“There are a few dozen more, but that is the most
important bit. It all amounts to one thing, and I believe you know what
that is.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Miss Hawpress will be accompanying me to the Foundry,”
Ryan said resignedly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That is right, Mr. Wells. She is waiting at the
front gates now. Dismissed.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, Sir.” Ryan turned to leave. Facing the door,
he was surprised to see a copy of Tunnoc's Utility Calendars hanging on
the interior surface. This month’s diagram was of the new Mancatcher design,
which sported a collapsible shaft that allowed for a hip sheath for faster
retrieval, rather than the normal sheath that fitted on an officer’s back.
The calendar looked incredibly familiar, right down to the note scrawled
in next week to report for guard duty at the front gates of the Barracks.
“Sir, isn’t that-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Dismissed, Mr. Wells,” Wheally said behind him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, Sir.” Ryan opened the door and with one last
mournful look at the calendar which had cost him three gold commons, exited
the office.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan had asked Gracin to meet him in the inner courtyard
before leaving for the Foundry. The Notary One was less than enthusiastic
about the Guvner representative joining them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It’s too dangerous Sir,” he said darkly. “She might
<i>slip</i> and fall into a furnace.” He grinned dangerously. “Or stumble
into a kettle of liquid iron. Or accidentally get her head cut off by a
swinging sword.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan spared him a small smile. The image certainly
was enjoyable to contemplate. But it was only an instant before he was
all business again. “No, none of that is going to happen.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“With all due respect, Sir, why not?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Firstly, because it would do more harm than good.
Secondly and more importantly, because those are our orders! Are you going
to disobey them?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gracin snapped to attention.. “No, Sir!</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You’ve been through intensive training on Arcadia
and have fought deadly Tanar’ri with nothing but a thin piece of metal
between its teeth and your heart! Are you going to let yourself be intimidated
by a glorified scribe?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“No, Sir!!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Right! Move out!“</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Marching briskly, they moved out of the inner courtyard
and through the front gates of the Barracks. Gina stood across the street,
arms crossed, leaning with her back against the wall behind her, standing
guard to prevent any escape from the Barracks. Her blue hair was now pulled
and tied at the nape of her neck with a leather thong. She still wore her
long jacket, but underneath it a dark brown leather jerkin replaced her
white shirt. Laced tightly up the front, it hugged her torso in a way that
emphasized the subtle curves of her small form. Her polished black shoes
were now boots, silver buckled up to her calves to disappear into her leather
breeches. On her hands were a pair of black leather gloves. Her glare seemed
all the sharper through the lenses of her glasses.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gracin leaned down slightly behind Ryan and whispered,
“I’m not so sure that she’s not worse than the Tanar’ri, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was inclined to agree. “Courage, soldier,” he
said out of the corner of his mouth. Firmly setting his face into what
he hoped was a calm expression, he strode forward toward the waiting woman.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Good morning, Miss Hawpress,” he said neutrally.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You’re ten minutes late Mister Wells,” she accused.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The calm facade cracked slightly. “I had a meeting
with my commanding officer,” he said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Well, it’s nice to know you at least spend some
time doing more than breaking things. Let's go.” She turned abruptly and
walked in the direction of the Lower Ward.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Liquid iron,” Gracin muttered suggestively.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Pike it,” Ryan said through clenched teeth. He set
out after Gina, his eyes boring balefully into her back.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As they made their way through the ever more-crowded
streets, the air quality diminished steadily. A yellow-grey haze appeared
and thickened in the air around them, giving everything a sickly sheen.
It wasn’t long before they could see the dark silhouettes of the Foundry’s
smoke stacks, the upward curve of Sigil’s ring making the spires seem to
tilt forward towards them. Oily black smoke belched forth from their tops,
so thick that it only traveled for a short way into the air before drifting
back down to settle on the surrounding streets and buildings.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan hated the Lower Ward. At least the Hive was
only dirty and filled with crime. In the Lower Ward the dirt was more subtle.
It was all-pervasive, assailed his senses until he no longer noticed it.
Then it crept into his hair and clothes, clung to his armor like rust.
There was crime here too, but it was equally subtle. There was a feeling
that something was wrong but Ryan could never put his finger on it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The great iron-wrought gates of the Foundry were
a mass of spikes and sharp curls, rising up between them and the structure.
It was nearly impossible to see where they opened. Just inside, wearing
the uniform of the Godsmen, was a guard. He looked at the Harmonium soldiers
suspiciously as they approached. “Yes?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We want to speak with Thorpal Corvex,” Ryan said,
stopping opposite the iron fencing from the guard.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Do you have an appointment?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was about to say that they didn't need one when
Gina cut in. “Yes, we do. My name is Gina Hawpress.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The guard looked down at her. “Ah, Miss Hawpress.
I was told to expect you.” He reached up and pulled something in the grillwork.
There were several metallic clangs and the huge metal doors swung ponderously
inward, their hinges screeching.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“When did you make an appointment?” Ryan asked as
they stepped inside the front yard. There were stacks and piles everywhere
of raw ore, as well as finished products in the forms of metal bars and
ingots.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Last night,” Gina said without looking at him. “I’m
surprised you didn’t think to. The Foundry works day and night non-stop.
Forge work is a very precise science and requires a great deal of timing.
If I hadn’t, we might have had to wait for hours.” She spared him a sidelong
glare. “Certainly a waste of the city’s time and money, wouldn’t you agree?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan clenched his teeth and bit back a response.
A young man wearing soot-stained clothes met them at the main doors to
the Foundry proper. “Please follow me,” he said, opening the doors.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As they followed him inside, Ryan was hit by a wave
of dry heat. His armor soaked up the arid atmosphere instantly and became
altogether too confining.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The interior of the building was dominated by a huge
room two hundred feet across with walls stretching up to a vaulted ceiling
blackened with the smoke and soot of centuries, lit by an orange-red glow
emanating from the great vats containing molten metals in the center of
the area. The dull, heavy roar of the flames beneath the vats filled their
ears, punctuated by the clang of metal against metal as three score smiths
did their work both at the huge kettles and in the smaller workrooms that
lined the walls in small alcoves. The Believers of the Source, or Godsmen,
believed that all life in the multiverse existed as a huge ladder. Live
a good life, and when you died you were promoted to a higher being in your
next life. Live a poor life, and you were knocked down a few rungs. According
to them, the ladder even extended up to the gods themselves, and beyond.
To them, the mutiverse was a forge in which life was refined and purified
until it reached its final perfection. It was for that reason that the
faction’s headquarters in Sigil was the Great Foundry. Working to burn
away impurities and fashion metal into tools and useful items was a living
example of their belief.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The young man led them past numerous work stations
where smiths fashioned iron into simple items such as hinges, spades, and
even plates and bars. At the rear of the large room, he opened a large
door, revealing a stone ramp that curled downward into darkness, wide enough
to wheel a cart through. As they descended, the sounds of the smiths faded
and the roar subsided into a vibration that thrummed up their legs through
the floor.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“This is where our members pursue more specialized
crafts,” the young Godsman said as he led them down past several large
iron doorways before stopping at one which seemed no different from the
rest. Grasping the handle, he pushed down and pulled the door open. The
heat, which had diminished as they put distance between themselves and
the forge above, hit them again from inside the room. The roar once again
reasserted itself as well.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’ll leave you to him,” the young man said. “You
may find your own way out.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan thanked the man and entered the room. Five furnaces
of varying sizes were situated against the left wall. Each one held a small
pair of doors at waist height with a circular hole in the center, through
which a bright orange glow emanated. Taking up most of the opposite wall
was a huge rectangular oven. The walls themselves seemed a jumbled mass
of pipes and valves that disappeared into the stone above, below and behind.
Occupying the space in the center of the room were four metal benches.
Two of them were occupied.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Miss Hawpress, is it?” a voice came from the right.
It belonged to a bearded man wearing a sweat-soaked white shirt, dotted
with numerous scorch marks. He was fairly large around the middle and the
top of his head was bare, glistening with sweat. He held a waterskin in
his hands.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mister Corvex?” Gina asked, holding out her hand.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The man took it. “Guilty. What can I do for you?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan cleared his throat loudly. “We want to know
what kind of relations you had with a man named Zertich.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Zertich? Yes, I’ve had many dealings with him. Quite
a few special orders. Why, what’s he done?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“He hasn’t done anything, I’m afraid he’s dead. We’re
investigating his murder.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Well I certainly didn't do it! I’ve been working
round the clock to fill those orders of his, and I’ve been paid well for
it. That wizard’s been my best customer over the past two years, and I’m
sorry to hear he’s gone.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan waved aside the claims of innocence. “We know
you didn’t do it. What were these special orders?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal gestured them to follow him as he walked
toward the back of the room. “I just sent the last box out yesterday, but
I’ve still got a few pieces lying around.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As they passed them, Ryan saw that the men sitting
at the benches were working with long pipes, on the end of which were strange
honey colored bubbles that the apprentices were prodding at with strange
tools. “What is it that you do here?” he asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I work with glass,” he said as he led them to the
far wall. “Blow it, shape it, mold it, you name it.” He opened a door similar
to the one which they used to enter the studio and led them into a smaller
room. Glass sheets of all shapes leaned against the walls and were stacked
a large table to the right, along with a few vases and sculptures. Another
door stood open at the far end, leading to what looked like a large storage
room. Hanging from the walls were dozens of iron files, blades, hammers
and other tools not as readily identifiable. “My cold-working room,” Thorpal
said, gesturing vaguely at their surroundings.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He walked to a relatively unoccupied area of the
long table and picked up a circular lens, nearly a foot in diameter. It
was rimmed in brass and connected at opposite poles to a crescent of metal,
which fastened to a heavy-looking stand. “It’s my habit to always save
one of what I’m working on for myself,” Thorpal said. “It helps the memory
if I ever need to make one again, plus it’s something to show potential
customers. Tends to impress them more than the notes and sketches in my
log books.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal eyed the piece critically. “Zertich said
that he had to enchant ‘em after I was finished with ‘em, so I s’pose his
look work a bit differently.” He set the piece on the table in front of
them and demonstrated how the fixtures allowed the large lens to pivot
to different angles. “Hold on a sec, I’ll find my notes.” As Thorpal disappeared
into the storage room, Ryan picked up the piece and looked through the
lens. There didn’t seem to be anything special about the thin, disc of
glass. He had half expected it to act like a magnifying glass, but nothing
seen through it looked any different.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He held it up and looked at Gracin and was surprised
to see the large man’s form lined in streaking rainbows of scintillating
colors. Although they were not the same unfamiliar colors he had seen while
using the Memory Stone, the effect was still impressive. The shaft of the
Mancatcher, visible above Gracin’s shoulder, shined brilliantly purple.
Ryan squinted as the glow grew brighter, filling up the lens. In a final
burst of light, the glass went dark.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Impressive, eh?” Thorpal was standing next to him
again, holding a stack of papers thick enough to be a book. “I’ll be blasted
if I know why it does that, but I figure it might be worth something to
a wizard some day. If nothin’ else, it seems to work like a pretty good
magic detector.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Blinking the spots from his eyes, Ryan looked through
the lens again. The rainbows had returned, but the Mancatcher now appeared
completely black. He put the lens back down on the table. “Was that what
was wrong with this piece, that Zertich didn’t want it?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yep. Said something ‘bout magic stuff not bein’
compatible with it or something like that. Said he didn’t need it. Still
paid for it, so I didn’t mind.” He held up the sheaf of papers. “Here’s
my notes, if they’ll do you any good.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan took the pile and paged through it briefly.
Lines of writing covered the sheets, surrounding several unintelligible
drawings. “I appreciate it Mr. Corvex, but-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Thank you Mister Corvex,” Gina interrupted, taking
the papers from Ryan’s hands. “I’m sure that they will be very useful.”
She gave Ryan a condescending glare as she set down the stack and began
going through them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Those Sensates must be well funded, I can tell you
that much,” Thorpal went on. “I don’t let just anyone play around in my
studio. But Zerich was in here with me for days at a time runnin’ his experiments
and such. Never saw so much messing with formulas for glass composition
and makeup and whatever else. It was lucky enough he wasn’t one o’ them
idiots that come in and seem to think I’m the all-powerful God of Glass
and they can order whatever they want and somehow I’ll just be able to
whip it out for them.” He flashed them a covert smile. “Not that there’s
any man who could do better in Sigil, mind you.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mr. Corvex, what are these here?” Gina held up several
sheets of paper. “They aren’t in the same handwriting as the rest.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Oh, there’s some of Zertich’ s notes mixed up in
there too. We were workin’ together quite a bit and sometimes on them late
nights stuff gets mixed together. I sometimes thought we were partners,
we spent so much time in here together. Not that those scribbles would’ve
done him any good. No order at all to ‘em, and he usually lost ‘em soon
as his pen left the paper.” He brightened up. “Hey, you wanna see something?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He picked up the large lens and walked back to the
outer room. “I was thinkin’ of asking Zertich to help me with a special
project to get a window put into the studio here.” He stopped at the doorway.
The two men were still working at the benches, rolling the long pipes back
and forth on the rails provided by the benches. One of them looked up at
the small audience. Thorpal scowled at him. “Pay attention to what yer
doin’ Reinhart!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The man looked to the glowing bubble on the end of
the pipe and yelped as he saw it drooping toward the ground. In his distraction,
he had stopped the constant rotating of the rod and allowed gravity to
take effect on the soft glass. Quickly resuming the back and forth spinning
and regained control.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal grunted. Holding up the lens in front of
Ryan, he said, “Take a look.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan took the lens and looked through it into the
room. The scene was amazing. Not only were the two men outlined in the
same colors Gracin had been, but so was everything else. The honey-like
glass on the poles had rainbows of orange and yellow drifting off of them,
soaking into the tools that manipulated them. The bubbles themselves glowed
a yellowish-green. As he watched, one of the men stood and walked to a
small door in the great oven, set at waist height. Holding the rod in one
hand, he used the other to grasp a wooden handle and open the door. White
and green poured into the air from within as the man stuck the rod into
the space. Upon pulling it out, the rod was suffused with color, and the
molten glass on the end had swollen. Ryan realized that the huge oven must
be filled with molten glass, keeping it heated and accessible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Thought it would be a great advertisement,” Thorpal
said. “Customers come by to see what I do and see somethin’ like that.
Had a feeling it’d go a ways toward sellin’ ‘em.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The scene Ryan saw through the lens flickered briefly
and the colors it added to the room shifted slightly, seeming to bend.
A vague silhouette appeared in the streaming rainbows, moving across the
room from the furnaces. The absence of colors drifted across the floor
and through one of the working apprentices, who did not appear to notice.
Ryan held up the lens so that Thorpal could see through it as well. He
pointed at the silhouette. “What’s that?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal peered through the glass curiously. The shape
had passed the benches. “I don’t rightly know. Never seen anything like
that happen before. It’s probably just a draft of air or-” He stopped short
as the silhouette ceased its motion. Ryan had an uncanny feeling that it
was looking at them. “How-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The sound they heard was the same screech that had
come from Zertich’s shop two days ago. Only this was not from a distance,
separated from them by intervening buildings and pedestrians. It was up
close and personal, ripping off the walls and shaking Ryan’s teeth inside
his skull. It grated off his nerves like an iron file.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When he opened his eyes again, he saw the silhouette
move toward the oven. With a shriek of twisting metal, the small door seemed
to tear itself from its fixtures before flying straight at them. Ryan grabbed
Thorpal and dropped, pulling the craftsman to the ground with him. The
steel rectangle flew over their heads and into the room beyond. Glass shattered
behind them and Ryan had to force Thorpal back down as the man gave an
anguished cry and tried to go back into the storage room.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shoved the lens into Gina’s hands and drew his
sword, running into the studio. He swung at the air where the silhouette
had been, but his sword found no resistance. With the door completely gone,
heat poured into the studio from inside the oven. Ryan watched in astonishment
as several of the bricks lining the open space ripped themselves from the
rest of the oven and leapt toward him. He ducked again, this time swinging
his sword as he went down, aiming where the thing must have been. Once
again though, the blade cut only air.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">An yell of pain came from behind him. Ryan looked
and saw that one of the two apprentices who had been working had been hit
by the flying bricks. His arm was black and bleeding not only from the
impact of the stone, but the heat it had carried with it from the furnace
oven. White-faced, the man gripped his shoulder above the wound, knowing
from experience not to touch the serious burn.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Gracin!” Ryan called to the large man, who stood
protectively in front of Gina and Thorpal with his sword drawn. “Mancatcher!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gracin shoved his blade back into its scabbard and
in one swift motion, grasped the polearm over his shoulder, pulling it
free from its straps. He ran forward with the iron weapon in both hands.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Harmonium Mancatcher was a simple spring-loaded
vise on the end of a six-foot pole. Metal spikes ran along the interior
of the trap. What was special about the weapon was the fact that it was
enchanted. There were many denizens of the planes, and hence denizens of
Sigil, which possessed armor, or even skin, that was so tough that it could
only be penetrated by magically enchanted weapons. This often came along
with other, more offensively designed attributes, and the Harmoniun often
found the Mancatcher essential to dealing with these creatures. The Mancatcher
was designed to catch and hold disrupters of the Peace in circumstances
where it was preferable not to kill the offenders. Another valuable ability
of the Mancatcher was its stopping effect on teleportation, planeshifting,
and similar magical abilities which would allow a prisoner to escape more
mundane confinements.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gracin came forward, and as another cluster of bricks
became missiles aimed at Ryan, shoved the open weapon into a likely space
for the creature to occupy. With a turn of his wrists he released the catch
and caused the iron jaws to snap shut. They hit each other with a clang,
snaring nothing. Ryan skipped back from the liquid glass now flowing from
the widening hole. It dribbled to the stone floor and quickly lost their
orange glow, cooling into hard lumps of clear glass as the heat was absorbed
by the rock.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan dodged again as more bricks flew at him. This
time however, several globules of molten glass came with them. One hit
his shoulder and burned through the cloth to his chainmail. Another larger
drop landed on his back. Both quickly heated the metal beneath them, which
in turn seared Ryan’s skin. Grimacing in pain, he batted the glass off
with his sword.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The two workers were still standing at the far side
of the room, looking on in horror as their own forge rebelled against them.
Ryan shouted at them. “Get out of here!” The two men did not move, paralyzed
with fear. Summoning every ounce of commanding authority he could muster,
Ryan bellowed, “Move!!” Responding to the order almost without thinking,
the two men stumbled out the open door into the passage beyond.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Suddenly something large and sharp hit Ryan in the
chest, bowling him backwards through the benches to land dangerously close
to the furnaces lining the wall opposite the oven. A moment later, he was
joined by Gracin as the big man was also thrown through the air. Grunting
in pain, Ryan struggled to his feet. He swung his sword back and forth
in front of him, though he knew it was useless.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Through the roar of the furnaces came a faint sound.
It took a moment for him to realize that Gina had yelled something at him.
He looked to where she and Thorpal still stood at the inner door. Thorpal
was holding the lens in front of her while she looked through it at him.
Her hands moved back and forth in complicated patterns. In the same instant
he realized that she was casting a spell, he finally comprehended her shout.
“Look out!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Too late, he tried to dive to the floor as something
caught him around the neck. It didn’t even have a texture to it as whatever
it was that held him squeezed harder, lifting him until his feet left the
ground. It was as if the air itself was strangling him. He struggled for
breath, tearing at his throat and trying to kick whatever held him, but
there was nothing there. As blackness closed in at the edges of his vision,
he was vaguely aware that Gracin was swinging the Mancatcher through the
air front of him, trying to hit the thing holding him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Something whirred past from the direction of Gina,
into the collected furnaces. Ryan felt himself losing consciousness, drifting
away from awareness. Gracin’s angry shouts faded. He couldn’t feel the
pressure on his neck anymore, but he didn’t care because he didn’t feel
the need to breathe anymore either.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Abruptly, the sensation ended and Ryan was thrust
back into a world of sound, light, heat, and pain. Lots of pain. The pressure
around his neck was gone and the room spun crazily around him. Then the
spinning stopped very suddenly as he slammed into something hard and unyielding.
He slid limply down the wall and landed on the floor in a dazed heap. The
room was spinning in a whole new way now, and Ryan thought it best to wait
before trying to get up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You didn’t tell me you was going to shoot acid at
it! I thought you was just going to blast it with fire or somethin’!” Ryan
didn’t quite recognize the voice, but he thought it might be Thorpal.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Oh yes, fire would have obviously hurt it!” He immediately
recognized the second voice as Gina. “You could tell it was really being
burned when it picked up those three-thousand degree bricks!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Do you know how much it cost me to have all that
build exactly right? Not to mention how hard it was to convince the other
smiths to even let me set up a studio in the main Foundry? Half of them
don’t think working glass is even real smithing. Gorvan’s been eying this
space for years for his Mithril workin’. You can bet he’s already trying
to convince the Factol that I’m just a fool who doesn’t know a crucible
from a cast-mold.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What the hell just happened!” Ryan shouted. He had
climbed his way to a more or less standing position against the wall. Most
of his clothes had been charred, his armor was incredibly hot, and he was
covered in fine white ash. Thorpal recovered from his shock first, though
his first statement did little to soothe Ryan’s anger. “You’re still alive?”
the craftsman asked incredulously.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina spoke up next. “I shot an acid arrow at it.
It was all I could think of.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal’s anger overtook his astonishment and he
turned on the smaller woman. “All you could think of? Shooting acid into
a delicate mechanism? You have no idea how much that cost me! Your little
Fraternity of Order is going to be receiving a bill, from me you-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Shut up!” Ryan ordered. “What happened?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"The acid didn’t hit it. It went right though it
and into the pipes and all that behind those furnaces. I must have hit
something vital, because after a moment, the whole thing exploded. You
were thrown in here.” She hesitated before continuing. “I don’t think Gracin
made it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked around himself for the first time. He
was in the cold-working room again. Beyond, the studio had been transformed
into a raging inferno. Gouts of orange and yellow flame spewed forth from
both walls where the oven and furnaces had once been. He couldn’t even
see the far door in the glare. The glass which had spilled to the floor
was reheated by the rampant flame and added to by the contents of the demolished
furnace. It was slowly inching its way across the floor.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Can you turn all that off?” he asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal shook his head. “It’s all connected to the
same enchantments that power the main forge above us. We’ll have to wait
for the men on the other side to shut everything down.” A worried look
crossed his face. “Shut it down... oh Gods! They’ll have to shut down the
whole forge to get us out! There’ll be unbelievable amounts of work lost!
Not to mention the time needed to start everythin’ up again.” He buried
his face in his hands. “I’ll never be allowed to work in the main Foundry
again. I’ll be lucky to get a space inside of Sigil after this.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was still watching the spreading pool of molten
glass. It was nearing the doorway to their room. “Corvex, how much glass
was in there?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Only about fifty gallons." He looked at the spreading
pool. “Of course, we might be seeing considerably more than that.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Why?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal ran a hand over his bald plate worriedly.
“Well, see Zertich needed to have as much time as possible to run his experiments,
and I have to charge the oven every night. Dump in raw sand and a few other
ingredients, then wait around while it all melted and mixed together with
the old stuff.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“So Zertich comes up with the bright idea of getting
a few imps to do the job for us. The little demons’re immune to the heat,
so they can go right into the oven and mix the stuff up.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I thought Zertich couldn’t summon things,” Ryan
said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal shook his head. “Oh, he didn’t summon ‘em.
He went out and hired ‘em right off the street. Payed ‘em twenty-five gold
commons a week to keep the oven full, night and day. Even got ‘em to crawl
in through the smoke stacks to do it so they wouldn’t disturb him in here.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What’s the catch?” Gina asked, though it sounded
like she had already guessed the answer.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal sighed. “They’re paid through the end of
the week.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked from one to the other. “So?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“There’s a very old story that almost all wizards
know,” Gina said. “About a lazy sorcerer’s apprentice who summoned an imp
to do his chores for him while his master was away. He handed the imp a
bucket and told it to take water from a nearby spring to the well in his
master’s home in the mountains. Then the lazy apprentice fell asleep.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“The sorcerer came back that night to find his cellar
completely underwater, the imp still carrying buckets of water down into
the depths to ‘dump’ them into the submerged well.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked out into the inferno again. “What exactly
did you instruct the imps to do?” he asked Thorpal.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Keep the glass up to a certain level in the oven.
But with the glass spilling out like that…”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It won’t reach that level inside until it reaches
it out here,” Ryan finished for him. The craftsman nodded solemnly. “Can
you just yell at them to stop?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“No, they’re evil little bastards. If I shouted at
‘em, they’d just say they were fulfilling their contract and go right on
filling it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan reached up and closed the door to the studio,
cutting off the waves of heat from the inferno. “How long before they can
shut all that off and get to us?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal shook his head. “Not for several hours at
least. And that’s if they aren’t working on anything too important. It
could be longer if they are. Maybe a full day.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan eyed the metal door. “Something tells me it’s
going to get hot in here soon.” He led them back into the storage room
and closed that door as well.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">Sitting against the wall, Ryan threw his chit and
watched it sail through the air to land in the large blue vase across the
room with a plink. The next three followed. He had started with the vase
ten feet away. Once he successfully thrown every chit into it in a row
he moved it back to fifteen feet. Then twenty. Now, with his back against
the wall and the vase against the opposite wall, it was fifty feet away.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The thin metal shelves that filled the room looked
more like display cases in an art show, filled with all manner of glass
vessels and sculpture. The blue vase Ryan had selected sat on a wide base
with a twisting, fluted neck.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He sighed and looked to where Gina and Thropal were
hunched over a table, now covered with Thorpal’s notes. They had been stuck
in the storage room for the last five hours. Gina had quickly become absorbed
in the notes and material on Zertich’s and Thorpal’s experiments and asked
numerous questions. Ryan was surprised that Thorpal readily supplied her
with answers. Most craftsmen in the Lower Ward guarded their secrets jealously.
The artist seemed to be glad for such an eager student though, and was
a font of information. Ryan had quickly become lost in their technical
dialogue.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I still don’t understand why the lenses need to
be circular,” Gina was saying. “From the rest of these calculations, it
seems that the glass could be any shape.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Zertich said that too,” Thropal said. “Let’s see
here,” he rifled through the now completely randomized piles of paper.
“Here it is.” Pulling out several sheets he pointed to a drawing. “Seems
it’s a... natural property of the multiverse or somesuch. Basically boils
down to the fact that a circle’s the only shape that can handle all the...”
He looked at another sheet. “Super… sensory emanations.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina nodded sagely. “Yes, it’s the Unity of Rings.
Things like that go hand in hand with the Rule of Threes. Now, what about
this refractory value here...”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan sighed again and started looking for a smaller
vase. He was interrupted by the sound of glass breaking from the cold-working
room. Immediately standing, he ran to the door and opened it to be blasted
by a wave of heat. Molten glass covered most of the floor, giving the room
a dull orange lighting effect. As he watched, the spreading pool reached
another of the large panes of glass leaning against the wall. Unable to
withstand the heat, the glass cracked and shattered.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Looking to the door across the room, Ryan saw that
it was red-hot. The lower edge had been bent outward by the pressure of
the glass on the other side and the thick liquid was now spreading quickly
across the floor toward him. Grimacing, Ryan shut the door again.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal and Gina stood behind him. “What is it?"
Gina asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“The glass is coming under the door. I don’t suppose
this one is any stronger?” Thorpal shook his head. “In that case we’ve
only got a few hours before it makes its way into here. Something tells
me that they aren’t going to get to us by then.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina was quiet for a moment. “How far apart are these
rooms down here?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Not far,” Thorpal said. “A foot of stone or so.
Why?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Because I do have another spell in my repertoire
that might help us. I could disintegrate a section of wall and we could
just walk right through into the next room.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan stared at her incredulously. “Why didn’t you
say that in the first place? We could have been out of here hours ago!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She gave him a baleful glare. “I don’t destroy things
at the drop of a hat, Mister Wells. If possible, I prefer to keep things
around me in an intact state. However, it appears we have no other choice.
Mister Corvex, with your permission?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal was adamantly shaking his head back and forth.
“No, that’s impossible, Miss Hawpress. There’s all kinds of piping and
things I don’t begin to understand runnin’ through these walls. It’s more
convenient bein’ down here, ‘cause we can hook up to the main forge. That
way we don’t have to bother with runnin’ each of our own individual ones.
You go around disintegrating chunks of that stone and there’s no telling
what‘ll come spewing out.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina sighed in disappointment.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A tiny candle of inspiration lit inside Ryan’s brain.
“Miss Hawpress, how much have you learned from Zertich’s notes?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Quite a bit actually. Although Zertich was awful
at keeping notes, Mister Corvex here is quite astute about it. Zertich
seemed to write things down only when he happened to have a quill in his
hand. Even then it’s not much more than a reminder. ‘One part diamond dust,
three parts quartz,’ or ‘No more copper in frames.’ That sort of thing.
But if I supplement them with Mr. Corvex’s writings, I can understand most
of them. His Theories are quite fascinating. He really was a visionary,
if you’ll pardon the pun, in the realm of sight. There are so many?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, yes.” Ryan waved his hand to bring her back
to him. “But could you duplicate his spell?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina stopped short. “What? That's absurd. Magic isn’t
like that, Mr. Wells. I can’t just read how to do it and then do it myself.
It takes experiments and meditating on magical energies and patterns. Days
of work and study.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan reached up and felt the iron door. It was already
uncomfortably warm to the touch. “You’ve got about five hours or so. If
you can manage to enchant one of those left-over pieces that Thorpal has,
I might be able to use it to get us out of here.” He took her by the arm
and propelled her back toward the table.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How?” she asked, already searching through the documents.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“When I used that Memory Stone in the Civic Festhall,
I experienced a memory of Zertich’s. He cast a spell on a pair of glasses
and put them on, Looking through them, I could see through the walls in
his workroom. If you can enchant one of these lenses here, then I might
be able to use it to show you where on the wall to cast that spell.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina looked at him in silence for a moment. It was
almost as if Ryan could see the gears turning in her head, methodically
working through the possibilities. Finally, she nodded. “All right. I can
try.”</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">The next few hours were a flurry of activity as Gina
sorted through the mis&shy;matched notes, drawing out anything written
by Zertich. Before, it had been interested reading, but now she was studying
in earnest. Producing a quill pen and inkwell of her own, as well as several
sheets of parchment from her pack, she quickly catalogued them into an
itemized list. After that she delved into the writings of Thorpal and separated
them by date, subject, and relevance. Within the space of an hour she had
completely transformed the random pile into several neat stacks. After
that, the work truly began. Gina’s pen was a blur across the page as she
took entries from the notes and compiled it into specific information.
Thorpal was soon scrambling to find her more paper as she ran out, in addition
to answering very technical questions. Luckily, Zertich had done a great
deal of his experimentation in the studio and Thorpal had been witness
to most of it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was meanwhile occupied looking for a suitable
lens to use. The larger one had been lost in the explosion of the forge,
though the early prototype would likely have been useless. To add to the
problems, Thorpal was not nearly as ordered with his actual pieces as he
was with his notes. It seemed that he took the actual creation process
as being more important than the end result, and once he was finished with
the work, it was more or less stored away and forgotten in favor of a new
project. Ryan searched the storage room and found assorted lenses lying
everywhere. More often than not, he would present the craftsman with a
circle of glass only to be told that Zertich had deemed it unusable.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, after three hours worth of searching, he
presented Thorpal with a lens two inches in diameter. He had found it inside
a sparkling green goblet with a stem shaped like a quasit, holding the
bowl on its shoulders. Unlike most of the others he found, which had been
simple circles of glass, this one had been rimmed in polished iron. Thorpal
nodded eagerly, taking the disc from Ryan’s hand. “Aye, this’ll do nicely.
It was part of a larger batch that all worked out well. It ought to still
be usable.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked to the iron door. The lower edge was
glowing a ruddy red, and the temperature had been increasing steadily in
the room for the last half hour. The small passages leading to the giant
main chimneys in the stone above them did not provide enough ventilation,
and the air could not expel the excess heat it was gaining from the door.
It seemed likely they would be suffocated by it before the glass inched
its way across the floor to reach them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Another hour passed. The bottom edge of the door
was glowing brightly now, and Ryan could see a thin glowing line of orange
beneath it. He had suggested to Thorpal that they might take apart one
of the metal shelves and brace it against the floor to block the glass,
but Thorpal had told him sadly that the shelves were not nearly as high
quality as the doors, and wouldn’t last more than a few minutes under the
heat of the melted glass.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked to where Gina was hunched over the table.
She had taken off her jacket in the now oppressive heat and hung it on
the corner of one of the cases. Her hair was frazzled, several strands
had escaped the knot at her neck and hung loose around her face. Sweat
glistened on her exposed shoulders and dripped off her perspiring face.
She was now writing on the backs of Thorpal’s other notes and instructions,
having run out of blank pages.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How’s it coming?” he asked, glancing at the ever-widening
line of orange underneath the door.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Not good,” she replied without looking up. Her quill
continued to scratch along the paper even as she spoke. “Zertich was dealing
with things that no one had ever seen before, whole new sensations. Since
no one had ever seen them before, we didn’t have any words for them in
our language. He had no way to describe them. It would be like trying to
describe the color red in terms of blue. So he made up his own words to
describe them with. Unfortunately, he didn’t write down anything that shows
how these words relate to each other.” She placed the page of notes she
was copying from in one of the neat stacks of paper, took a sheet from
another pile and resumed writing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I thought that Guvners could read any language,
since they were so good at finding patterns and whatever else,” Ryan said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That is true, but the main reason for that is that
eighty-two percent of almost all languages describe the same things. Every
language has a word for big, a word for small. Once you understand that,
it’s only a matter puzzling it out by using the relationships between those
things. The only time that a language won’t have a word for something is
if the people who use it have never encountered it before. The desert elves
of Gharrtak, for instance, have no word in their language for lake, or
ocean. That’s because Gharrtak is an entire world of deserts, without a
single body of water larger than a small pond. They’ve never seen an ocean
before, so why would they have a word for it?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“These things Zertich talks about though.” She paused
in her writing to glance at another sheet. “Eckses and Gamas, among others.
No one has ever seen them. There have never been words applied to them
before, and that means that I have no frame of reference whatsoever.” She
stopped writing and stood up straight.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I think I have enough information to try to scribe
a spell,” she said, moving all the notes but hers to the far edge of the
table. “I don’t have the proper materials to create a scroll, so after
I write it all out, I still need to actually go through the process of
committing the magical pathways and energies to my mind before casting
it.” She cast a worried glance at the glowing door. “I’m not sure if I
can do it in time.” Ryan nodded. “Do your best.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ignoring Thorpal’s protests, Ryan pushed over one
of the metal shelves. Vases and sculptures of all shapes and sizes shattered
on the floor, punct&shy;uating Thorpal’s anguished cries. Bracing his booted
foot against it, Ryan pushed the metal across the stone floor and up against
the door. It would only buy them a few minutes, but he was willing to take
what he could get. True to Thorpal’s word, the thin metal quickly surrendered
to the onslaught of heat and crumpled around the oncoming glass.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It became hard to breathe in the confined room. As
the temperature rose, several of the glass works began to crack and even
shatter as the heat became too much for them. Ryan finally took his armor
off before it cooked him alive, silently vowing not to leave it behind.
He and Thorpal looked on silently as Gina scribbled furiously. The glass
was a third across the room when she declared that she had finished writing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As the spreading pool came closer, the case of notes
Thorpal kept burst into flames. The heat pouring forth from the glass was
intense when Gina turned from the table and said she was ready. Ryan handed
her the lens quickly, looking at the burning papers in anxiety. Black smoke
rose into the air from the shelf. They wouldn’t have much time left before
they couldn’t breathe at all.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina took the lens and set it on the floor just as
the glasses had been in the vision Ryan had seen through the Memory Stone.
As he watched her chant the arcane words and gesture toward the glass,
he was struck with a strange feeling of familiarity. Finally the chant
rose to a crescendo and ended with Gina pointing at the glass circle.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Knowing that the spell was over, Ryan quickly bent
down and picked up the lens. Holding it up to his eye, he looked through
it and was relieved to see the same astonishing scene he had seen through
the glass in the memory stone. Most readily evident were the dull, heavy
colors which streamed forth from the liquid glass. It bathed them all,
overpowering the auras Ryan now understood to be the heat of their own
bodies. It was as if all the normal colors which he had seen before still
existed, but had now been added to and increased tenfold. He raised his
hand and once again saw through it to the bones and muscle hidden within.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Did it work?” Gina asked desperately.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan turned to answer, but his words died in his
throat. He could still see what he had come to accept as ‘Gina,’ but he
could also see a great deal more. A dozen auras of different size and color
surrounded her body. A dagger, concealed in her boot shined and sparkled
in bright unfamiliar colors. A ring contained in her left hip pocket shone
with equal intensity. He could see through her body to her bones and organs
and was shocked to witness her heart, beating swiftly inside her chest.
What took him most by surprise though, was that although he could see through
her clothes and skin, he could still see her <i>skin</i>. She might as
well have been standing naked before him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Did it work?” she asked again.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Blinking hard, Ryan spun away from her. “Yes, it
worked,” he forced out. This time, Ryan concentrated very hard on surveying
the walls of the room. Thorpal had been right. There were dozens of pipes
and lines running through the stone. Most glowed with heat, but others
emitted different colors he had not yet learned to recognize. One even
sparkled with the same strange energy that Gina’s ring and dagger had.
They crisscrossed through the wall like the web of an insane spider.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Scanning the chaos, Ryan searched for a space large
enough for them to crawl through. Finally he spotted an opening, perhaps
two feet by three, about five feet from the floor. Beyond it was a store
room similar to the one they were in, minus the creeping pool of deadly
glass. The shelves seemed to be stocked with jewelry and ornamentation.
He walked to the spot and pointed. “Here. It leads into another store room.”
Gina rushed to her jacket and produced a piece of chalk, which he used
to outline the section of stone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The smoke was a heavy pall in the air now, combining
with the heat to make the air nearly unbearable. Ryan tore a strip of cloth
from his shirt and used it to cover his mouth and nose. Gina was wheezing
heavily, but would not do the same, needing to be able to enunciate clearly
to cast the spell. Thorpal breathed shallowly and did not seem to be as
badly affected by the horrid air.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Raising her hands, she began chanting again, her
eyes fixed on the spot Ryan had outlined on the wall. Her breath came in
short gasps between the arcane words, but she pressed on resolutely. Ryan
winced as her voice cracked once. Finally she finished, and the wall exploded
outward in a cloud of dust from the space shown by the chalk. Gina bent
over double, coughing and choking on the poisonous air.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal was already at the opening, clambering up
into the next room. Ryan grabbed Gina's leather jacket where she had hung
it in one hand and physically picked up the woman herself in the other.
He carried her to the opening and lifted her up where, still coughing badly,
she managed to grasp Thorpal’s outstretched hand. After the craftsman had
hauled her up and out, Ryan wadded up the jacket and threw it through as
well. He then retrieved his armor along with her pack and, pushing them
ahead of him, crawled out of the deadly room.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal was gently but firmly guiding the weakened
woman out of the room while she feebly protested. “The notes!” she said
between coughs. “We can’t… just leave them… there!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It’s too late,” Ryan said, juggling his hot armor
from one hand to the other. “I saw them already smoldering when I climbed
out.” Gina’s groan of morning for the lost knowledge ended in another fit
of coughing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They exited the storage room and entered another
forge, although it was almost completely different in design from Thorpal’s
studio. Kettles and molds decorated the walls, and only a single small
furnace stood up against one wall. An old man looked up from working on
a bejeweled amulet.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Thorpal!” he shouted in astonishment. “What in the
Nine Hells are you doing in my storage room? You’re supposed to be roasting
alive in you studio!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Quite a bit of touching sentiment there Haelicus!”
Thorpal retorted. “Pardon me while I dry my eyes! Where is everyone?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Haelicus looked at the large man blankly. “Everyone
who?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Everyone who’s supposed to be saving me from a fiery
death!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Haelicus shrugged. “Oh, them. Well there’s that big
order from the Mercykillers to think about, retiling the roof of the Prison
and all. And this is the busiest time of year for us. The high-ups voted
on it and decided that the most convenient time to shut down the furnaces
and handle the problem would be about… three months from now.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Three months!” Ryan stooped and caught Gina as Thorpal
let go of her in his anger. “They could have scraped us off the wall by
then!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“They agreed you would be happier in your next life.
Especially when they found out where all that fire was coming from.” Thorpal
paled considerably. “You know we’re only supposed to tap the secondary
furnaces, Thorpal. That inferno in your studio is coming directly from
the main forge.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked at the larger man accusingly. “You told
us that it was standard procedure to connect to the main forges.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Haelicus nodded absently, his attention once again
on his work. “It is, but only very important, or high priority projects
will get a craftsman the privilege to tap those fires.” He placed a pick
on one of the jewels in the amulet and rapped lightly on the other end
with a small hammer. “And then there’s also the fee. A little too steep
for you, eh Thorpal?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Thorpal groaned. “I needed the extra power! Zertich’s
experiments were too much for the secondary furnaces. Gods, I wish I’d
stayed in the studio. The high-ups’ll cast me in iron and then melt me
into slag.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan helped Gina stagger past the arguing craftsmen
and into the hallway. Several feet down the slope, a pair of men were working
to lay bricks down in front of the door leading to what once was Thorpal’s
studio. The door they were covering glowed orange with the heat behind
it. It looked like the makeshift wall was intended to last longer than
three months.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As the two emerged from the hall into the main forge
room, Ryan heard familiar shouting. Siere loomed over a smaller man in
a leather apron. She had her hand on her sword.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I don’t care how inconvenient it is! You said you
would be able to have that blasted furnace shut down by now. Now I get
back and you’re telling me that you’re not going to shut it off at all?
What about Officer Wells?” She picked up the man by his collar with one
hand. “You shut down that fire now, or by the Lady I’ll come back here
with a hundred Harmonium men and women and a hundred hammers and chisels
and we’ll get him out of there ourselves! And don’t you think we can’t,
because there’s a Guvner in there too. We’ll get ourselves a piece of paper
that says we can do whatever we want to your little foundry!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Stand down, soldier,” Ryan said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Siere dropped the smith in surprise. “Sir? Is that
you?” The smaller man scurried away in the moment of distraction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Of course it’s me. Why wouldn’t-” Ryan realized
that he was still in his underclothes, dragging his armor behind him in
one hand and supporting Gina in the other. His face was probably still
covered in soot and ash from the exploding forge. He wondered how much
hair he had left. “We escaped,” he said simply.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He looked out through the main doors, where a team
of horses were dragging in a cart of unrefined ore to be smelted. The sky
was dark outside. “Our shift’s over,” he said wearily. “Let's go report
in.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Siere nodded. “Yes, Sir.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina had recovered her strength enough to accompany
them back into the crowded Sigilian streets without support. Once they
had escaped the oven-like atmosphere of the Foundry, Ryan shrugged back
into his armor. Gina also put back on her own jacket. She checked her pockets
and cried out in alarm. “Half my things are ruined!” She hastily pulled
out several half-melted candles and other heat-sensitive items from various
pockets before they could harden completely and become forever stuck to
the insides of her jacket.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">The Barracks loomed imposingly against the dim night
sky. The dark silhouette was a block of pitch against the charcoal sky.
Ryan bid Gina a tired goodnight and walked through the main gates.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Inside, Ryan filled out a brief report, detailing
the facts of what had happened at the Foundry. He knew that he would be
explaining the particulars of it to Wheally tomorrow morning.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, he slumped through the destroyed door to
his room. He washed his face in the basin and looked at himself in the
small mirror he used to shave. His eyebrows were gone for the most part,
but his actual hair seemed to have escaped the fire with only minor singeing
and was perhaps a half-inch shorter.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Knowing that he would have to get up early tomorrow
to brush the ash and soot out of his chainmail armor, he left a note tacked
to the outside of his door to be woken at four hours past anti-peak. The
guards who constantly patrolled the Barracks’ interior would knock on his
door to wake him as they passed at the appropriate time. As a result of
their rigorous training, it was a rarity that any member of the Harmonium
overslept. Ryan could regularly wake at six hours past anti-peak, but going
to sleep with a specific time in mind and then waking at that time was
a skill which he had never mastered.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Although he was bone-weary, Ryan found he could not
sleep once he had laid down in his cot. He stared at the ceiling, his mind
abuzz with thoughts. An invisible, intangible creature. It was incredulous
to him that such a thing could exist, or that the Lady of Pain would allow
it to do so inside Sigil. Even fiends like the Tanar’ri and Baatezu were
allowed to enter only on their best behavior. Ryan checked the thought
and amended it. Everybody was allowed to enter only on their best behavior.
If a demon started ripping things and people apart, it wouldn’t last long.
And in just the same manner, if a Deva or some other celestial being began
smiting all the evil he saw around him, he would be taken care of by the
Lady of Pain long before his task was completed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Maybe the Lady of Pain couldn’t see it either? No,
that was absurd. The Lady kept even the powers out of Sigil, and you didn’t
get much more omnipotent than a god. Sigil was connected to every corner
of the multiverse, although that corner was usually the shadowed, cobweb-shrouded
corner that never got swept out and you usually expected something poisonous
and with lots of legs to be lurking there. If any one god managed to get
into the City of Doors, that power could reach into innumerable worlds
and planes. It worked out for the best, most agreed. Because although most
priests would love to have their patron deity put the multiverse under
a thumb and be able to say ‘I was a worshiper before he reshaped the planes
in his image,’ they were all far more afraid of some one else’s god doing
it first.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Well, it wasn’t as if they’d actually killed anybody
before now. Ryan was pretty sure that there wasn’t any record of one committing
any crime for that matter. Perhaps the reason the Lady of Pain let them
exist in Sigil was because they didn’t really bother anybody. Until now.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A thought struck him just before he drifted into
sleep that made him sit straight up. What if it wasn’t murder? What if
Zertich had only been killed?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shouldered back into his clothes and grabbed
the lens Gina had enchanted. The lights of torches and candles stood out
clearly above in the night sky like a strip of yellow stars as Ryan rushed
out into the street. Reaching the center of the street, he stopped and
placed the glass over his eye. Slowly, he turned in a complete circle.
There! Two blocks down, something large walked through a shop wall and
into the street.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As if he were on patrol, Ryan walked toward the thing.
He donned the impassive face essential to the practice, looking straight
ahead, but still seeing his surroundings. As soon as a criminal realized
you were looking at him, he’d stop whatever he was doing before you saw.
The best way to catch them was to appear not to notice them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Eyes locked on the street ahead, Ryan approached
the creature as it lumbered through the street. His hand ached to snatch
the hilt of his sword, but he forced it to remain casually at his side
as he came near the thing. It continued walking, appearing to be oblivious
to Ryan's presence.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The eight-foot tall creature lumbered along on two
great legs that looked like tree trunks, right down to roots at the bottom,
which slithered and snaked into the ground each time it took a step. From
the enormous chest came two arms that seemed to hinge in strange ways as
they swung back and forth while it walked. They each ended in a three-fingered
hand, tipped with wicked talons. Its head was a strange diamond shape tipped
with a snout that reminded Ryan of an anteater. The thing’s mouth gaped
open, seeming to split the strange head in half, setting Ryan’s mind to
rest as to whether or not it could have made that awful screech. Two rows
of serrated teeth lined the interior.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was so intent on the creature that he did not
pay attention to where he was walking. With a sudden shock he realized
that their paths were going to cross. He couldn’t change course to avoid
it without alerting the thing that he knew it was there. Gritting his teeth,
Ryan walked on, staring straight ahead. The vision through the lens swam
as the creature passed through him. It was incredibly unnerving for the
fact that he didn’t feel it at all. Not even a breeze. Then it was gone
and he was walking alone through the darkened street, not daring to look
back.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">Wheally was not in his office the next morning. When
Ryan thought about it, it wasn’t surprising. The Mover was in command over
those Harmonium who were on duty at the Festival. He was probably already
at the Alchemists’ Square, making sure things were progressing in an orderly
fashion.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina stood waiting for him outside, wearing the same
outfit she had yesterday. It looked as if it had been washed vigorously.
“Good morning, Mr. Wells,” She said, smiling.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan missed a step when he heard the friendly greeting.
He recovered quickly though. “Good morning, Miss Hawpress,” he said uncertainly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Guvner representative fell into step next to
him as they headed in the direction of the Alchemists’ Square. As they
approached, the streets were even more crowded than usual, thronged with
men, women and otherwise. Ryan noted that most displayed the symbol of
the Society of Sensation somewhere on their person.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Reaching the square, they found that it had been
completely transformed. What had once been an open space had been sectioned
off into a twisting chaos of narrow aisles walled by hundreds of makeshift
stalls and tents, each one professing to have some of the most amazing
sensations available for experiencing. Banners and flags hung everywhere,
whipping in the cool wind.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A large platform had been constructed at the far
end, closest to the Civic Festhall. Ryan could see the Sensate Factol Erin
Montgomery, along with Annli Webspinner and a few others whom he did not
recognize, but assumed were also important somehow. There was a steady
flow of Sensates past the platform, to and from the Civic Festhall, which
stood a block down the street. He assumed that they were recording their
experiences on the Memory Stones. The main reason for the Festival was
in fact to draw Sensates back to Sigil who had ventured out into the far
reaches of the Planes. They would spend weeks sorting through the hundreds
of recorded experiences for those that were actually unique and could be
kept in the Sensation Library.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan met Wheally on the fringes of the square. He
was briskly given his instructions along with Samon and Claire before the
commander rushed off to something else. Ryan relayed them to Siere, Atorre,
and Wiles. With Gracin’s death, he and Gina would walk alone, staying in
the confines of the square. The morning was uneventful for the most part.
Gina was surprisingly docile as they walked the booths and vendors. At
one point Ryan was forced to break up a fight at a stand over the last
mug of something the vendor called Lotus Nectar. Other than that however,
the Harmonium’s presence alone went a long way in discouraging law-breakers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">At peak, they found a small make-shift cafe to stop
for lunch. There was a long line to sit at one of the tables within the
tent, but Ryan pushed past the waiting creatures and took up a post at
the back wall, training his glare on the room in general. Animate conversation
began to lose momentum as the occupants became aware of the Harmonium dominating
the establishment. Gina watched quizzically as he remained immobile. After
another five minutes passed, a trio of tieflings which had been getting
more and more uneasy, stood from forgotten food and left. Quick and determined,
Ryan sprang into action and sat down at the table.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina joined him a moment later, trying to scowl at
him for a blatant flaunting of authority. “You cut in line,” she said.
The twitching corners of her mouth betrayed her amusement.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan appeared to be taken aback. “I didn’t think
anyone wanted this table,” he said innocently. He turned in his seat to
face the angry faces of those still in line, his face transforming as he
did so, becoming an expression of threatening menace. “Does anybody want
to sit here?” he barked. Anyone who looked like they might have objected
quickly closed their mouth as they met his glare. He faced Gina again,
all trace of hostility gone. “See?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina finally allowed her smile to reveal itself.
“You might have made a good member of the Fraternity of Order, Mr. Wells.
That’s an amazing use of Bergal’s Social Response Theorem.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan waved his hand dismissively at the term. “It’s
just an old Harmonium trick.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It took some time to convince the server that they
did not want the most spectacular and unique food on the menu. When he
finally brought them two plates of sandwiches, not to be discouraged, he
guaranteed under his breath that the bread was made with the grains of
a unique plant found only in certain areas of Arborea. Ryan thought it
tasted good enough.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As Gina finished her meal, she spoke finally. “All
right,” she said. “I’ve been patient. It’s obvious that you’ve solved the
mystery. When are you going to let me in on it?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan set down his sandwich. “On the world I grew
up on there was a snake called a Melbrok. It was poisonous as anything.
One bite and you were dead within the hour. It had amazing camouflage too,
green as the grass and most of the time you couldn’t even see it if you
looked for it. The thing you always had to remember though was <i>not</i>
to look for it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“The Melbrok only struck if it felt threatened. The
best way to threaten it was to look straight at it. Make eye contact. I
guess its reasoning was that if you were looking at it, then you could
kill it. I’d even heard that a man stepped on one and it didn’t do anything.
It just wriggled away.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina looked at him in silence for a moment. “You
think that those things that killed Zertich and attacked us only did it
because we could see them?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“They’ve never caused any trouble before. We can’t
see them. When someone does find a way to see them, they attack and kill
him. I saw that thing in the foundry walk through a wall, a furnace, and
one of the workers. Then I pointed at it and it stopped and attacked us.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You think there’s more than one?"</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“They’re all over the place. I went out last night
and looked for myself.” With regret, Ryan remembered arriving back at his
room just as the man on patrol knocked on his door to wake him. He stifled
a yawn.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina stiffened and looked covertly around her. “What,
you’ve seen them?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan took the lens from his pocket. It glittered
in the light and he caught a glimpse of the strange colors beyond. He lifted
it to his eye and fixed his face into the same blank stare he had last
night. Carefully, he turned his head and scanned the room and the street
outside. He didn’t let his eyes linger on anything, but glided his gaze
across the scene. When he was done, he put the lens back in his pocket.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“There’s one a few shops down,” he said. “And another
behind me.” As Gina’s eyes widened in fear, Ryan said quickly, “Don’t look!
It might think you can see it." She locked her eyes on his face.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“But those things are dangerous! We have to do something!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Dangerous to who? Nobody can see them or even touch
them. The only person who could is dead and all of his notes were destroyed
in that fire.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“But they’ve killed people!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Would you incarcerate a snake for biting someone?
These things aren’t intelligent. I agree with you that they’re dangerous,
but what can be done? I can count on one hand the amount of creatures that
a Mancatcher can’t contain. We can’t hurt them, contain them, or even touch
them. We have to be satisfied with the fact that right now they aren’t
a danger to anyone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“But-”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We have to pick our battles, Miss Hawpress. Maybe
with some very <i>careful</i> research and study we can eventually find
some way to affect them,” he held up the lens again. “But if you start
walking around with this thing in front of you, yelling and attacking every
time you see one of those monsters, all you will accomplish is sending
them into a berserk rage and getting more people killed.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina didn’t speak as she let this sink in. “I suppose
you’re right,” she said finally. “But that doesn’t remove the fact that
someone has been murdered. The laws are clear on the subject. Whoever or
whatever committed the crime must be apprehended.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan was ready for this however. He had spent much
of the morning rehearsing how to phrase it as he brushed his armor. “Not
if it isn’t really murder,” he said. “These things aren’t intelligent.
They’re just dangerous animals.” Gina had pulled the well-worn book from
her pack, labeled clearly, <i>Sigil Civic Code</i>, in silver letters.
She paged through it to what Ryan assumed would be the section dealing
with deaths.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes, you’re right. Clause five of Sigilian Law two
dictates that the term ‘murder’ shall only be applied to those creatures
of enough intelligence to understand and obey said Law.” She skipped her
finger to the bottom of the page. “Sub-clause one states that creatures
which do not possess enough intelligence must be referred to Law 24, dealing
with deaths by animals or natural circumstances.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan smirked. Leave it to the Guvners to find laws
for common sense. He finished his meal as Gina continued to read through
the huge tome. Finally, she closed the book with finality.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“That’s it,” she said, thumping the cover of the
book. “It’s all in there. Since it isn’t really murder that the creature
committed, we aren’t responsible for apprehending it. Normally such a dangerous
creature would of course have to be put to death. However, since there
isn’t any readily apparent way to do that, we must merely do our best to
make sure that circumstances do not arise in which another death may occur.
Since Zertich is gone and all his notes are destroyed, there is very little
chance that another situation could occur similar to that which killed
Zertich and Gracin.” She smiled triumphantly. “You see, Mr. Wells? It’s
all in the Laws, you just have to look for them.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan stared at her incredulously. She was talking
as if it had been her idea! As if she had just proven without a doubt that
she was right and he was wrong. He shook his head in disbelief. He was
prevented from saying anything however, by a voice from outside.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Fellow Sensates and other participants! I welcome
you to the twenty-first tri-annual Festival of Sensation!” The voice was,
Ryan assumed, magically enhanced so that it could be heard across the Promenade.
It was met by many cheers from the assembled participants. “I would like
to assure you that tonight’s main event will be like nothing you’ve ever
experienced before! In fact, it will be something that none of you have
experienced, period!” There were several murmurs from the crowd, showing
a great deal of doubt, but they weren’t about to let it dampen their spirits.
The murmurs quickly rose in volume to more cheers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked at Gina and could see the same thoughts
running through her head. “They sure whipped together another main event
quickly,” he said carefully. “One with such a grand statement preceding
it?” Gina shook her head. “That’s the same event.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As they left their seats, the server yelled at them,
forcing Gina to stop in order to pay the man.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“How could they know how to do it?” Gina asked as
she walked quickly along side him toward the stage.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shook his head. “Maybe Zertich was more forthcoming
with his research than we thought.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The crowd parted and Ryan stopped in front of the
erected stage. Spotting the stairs, he climbed them quickly, brushing aside
a man who tried to stand in his way. Once on top of the wooden structure,
he saw Erin Montgomery standing off to the side talking to Annli Webspinner.
The Factol was wearing a stunning blue dress that glittered yellow whenever
she moved.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He stepped up to them officially as he could. “Miss
Webspinner, we need to talk.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Of course,” the Bauriur woman said. “Excuse me,
Factol,” she said to Erin, who nodded her head and walked back toward the
others seated on the platform. “What can I do for you, Officer Wells?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We want to know more about your main exhibit,” Gina
said. “You led us to believe that your contact with the wizard Zertich
was ended.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It was,” Annli confirmed. “Luckily for us, our business
had been concluded that morning, before he was killed. Speaking of which,
did you ever find who had killed him?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“He found something that didn’t like being found,”
Ryan said. “What is your main event?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli took him to the edge of the stage and pointed.
At the tops of the flagpoles he could just barely see a glimmer at the
top of the pole. It was a Memory Stone. He looked to the other flagpoles
and could see the same spherical stones on top of them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What are they doing up there?” Ryan asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli took them back to a more secluded part of the
stage. “They’re the stones that we told you of before.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"I thought you were just going to make copies of
that one or something,” Ryan said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli lowered her voice even more. “They’re special
stones. The original stone will be activated and the experience will be
duplicated in these stones out here.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina peered up at the stones. They were at least
twenty feet off the ground. “How? No one will be able to reach them all
the way up there.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli glanced around nervously. Ryan stepped forward.
“Miss Webspinner, if it makes you feel better, I can assure you that neither
Gina nor I will repeat any of the information you give us. The Harmonium
understands the dangerous possibilities presented by the Memory Stones
and it has always been a great comfort to us that they cannot be taken
off of the grounds of the Civic Festhall. If it is possible to somehow
take them elsewhere, we would not tell anyone about it.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The woman visibly relaxed. “Thank you Mr. Wells.
The Memory Stones are not in and of themselves enchanted. Rather, they
are attuned to accept and store memories. There are several complicated
spells that go into it, but the end result is that in this specific place,
they can accept memories and store them. Once they leave this area, they
come out of harmony with the world around them and lose the ability to
contain the memories.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“These stones,” she nodded toward the flagpoles.
“Have been attuned to the Alchemists’ Square, rather than to the Civic
Festhall. They have also been... altered, so that it is not necessary to
touch them. When we begin to broadcast, all the people here will have to
do is clear their minds to receive the experience.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What is this experience that you are planning to
‘broadcast?’”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“One recorded by Zertich before he died. It is similar
to the one which you experienced, only intended to be experienced by a
large audience. I think Zertich had a speech prepared.” “That speech doesn’t
happen to include anything that might tell someone how to duplicate his
experiments does it?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli shook her head resolutely. “Definitely not.
Zertich may have been a genius and a visionary, but he certainly wasn't
opposed to making money off the deal as well. I believe he expected to
become the sole supplier of the means to experience the multiverse in entirely
new ways.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“He would have been a very rich man,” Gina agreed.
“The demand would have been incredible.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan thought about all those beings who would want
to have the ability to see through clothes and walls, or to see the inner
workings of a lock or the contents of a safe. Yes, Zertich couldn’t have
made them fast enough.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina nodded. “Thank you Miss Webspinner. We’re sorry
to have taken you away from your duties. It’s just that Zertich’s experiments
turned out to have been very dangerous, and we wanted to make sure that
they would not be repeated.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Annli nodded sadly. “It’s a great loss that he died.
I believe that he could have taken us far closer to ultimate understanding
of the Multiverse.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan and Gina left her on the platform and once again
descended to the flagstones of the Square.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The grey sky was well on its way to anti-peak when
the magically enhanced voice was heard again. The darkness had little effect
on the festivities, however, as several torches of varying colors sprang
to life all around the Promenade. “Ladies, gentlemen, and otherwise! May
I have your attention, please?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The sounds of the crowd quieted to a murmur, then
disappeared completely as all eyes turned to the stage. Ryan and Gina moved
to a crossroads in the aisles of shops so that they could get a clear view.
He could see Annli standing along side Erin at the front of the stage.
She said something to the Factol before turning and trotting across the
stage toward the Civic Festhall. Ryan guessed that she was going to activate
the Memory Stone herself.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin Montgomery continued. “Before we begin, I would
like to take a moment to recognize the wizard Zertich, whose studies and
research were what made this possible. I’m afraid that he was killed earlier
this week from what I am told was a danger of the experiments he conducted.
We have lost a great deal with his passing. Fortunately, his efforts were
not in vain and we may still benefit from his work.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Our goal, as you all know, is understanding. Under&shy;standing
of the world around us and of the multiverse itself. This can only be accomplished
by using what has been gifted to us: our senses. The more we experience,
the more we know. The more we know, the better our understanding becomes.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan crossed his arms and leaned back against one
of the flagpoles. He had heard this speech a hundred times before, from
nearly as many different Sensates. The other assembled people were drinking
it in with rapt attention though. Ryan didn’t mind hearing Factol Sarin
recite from the Book of Harmon&shy;ium, or commenting on the particulars
of its prescriptions, but this droning on and on about the importance of
just looking at things became tiresome quickly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"Zertich was unsatisfied with what he had been given
however,” Erin continued. “Many of us may have had similar feelings, but
Zertich was willing to do something about it. His ideas and theories were
unheard of. His inspirations astonishing. Through his work, we will be
able to understand far more than ever before.” She was met with cheers
from the crowd.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“And now, I ask that you all stand still and clear
your minds. You are about to be shown the fruits of his labor.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked above him and saw the Memory Stone at
the top of the flagpole begin to glow dimly. He could barely make out a
few others nearby, far above the street. His vision blurred slightly as
the Stones began to take over. Irritated, he mentally shrugged away the
invading sensations. Hundreds of people standing still in a daze would
be a cut-purse’s dream come true.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Memory Stones must have been made more powerful
to overcome the lack of physical contact though, because he could not fight
off the effect. He found himself once again standing in the small workroom
behind Zertich’s shop. A mirror was on the wall now, and through it Ryan
saw Zertich’s face. As the vision took hold, it became ‘his’ face, though
it still looked like Zertich.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He cleared his throat and smiled into the mirror.
“Esteemed members of the Society of Sensation. My name is Zertich, member
in good standing. I am pleased to tell you that I have recently made a
discovery which will forever alter the way we see and understand the multiverse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Although we, as Sensates, have honed our senses
to what some might call their peak potential, I am sad to say that this
is not the case. There is so much more out there than we could have ever
known. Spells which enhance our vision and hearing can do nothing to affect
this unfortunate fact. It is not sensitivity which we must increase, but
<i>range</i>. To this end, I have endeavored for many months to finally
create these.” He held up a pair of silver-framed glasses. “These devices
expand one’s range of vision far beyond what is normally possible.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan imagined that he heard a collective cry of amazement
as he put on the glasses and once again looked into the mirror. He saw
not only his (or rather, Zertich’s) reflection in the mirror, but <i>through</i>
it as well, into the front of the store. The colors were just as amazing
and unfamiliar as they had been to Ryan before.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I am proud to say that glasses and similar lenses
will be available for you to purchase once this demonstration is complete.
With them we will see far more of the multiverse than we ever had before.
Before then however, I would like to take this chance to describe to you
what you are seeing. Knowing this will prevent confusion as you use your
own lenses. I will begin with the most simple colors, those which you see
translated into visible color through infravision spells. You can see here...”
Zertich’s voice dimmed and the vision faded as anger shot through Ryan’s
veins. Running toward the platform, he shook his head, but could still
not block out the Memory Stones entirely.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Available for purchase? Those damned Sensates were
going to cause a massacre! Zertich droned on vaguely at the edges of his
perception, and Ryan had trouble keeping balance as the interior of the
wizard’s shop, with all its amazing colors, was superimposed over the crowded
Square.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A glimpse of blue hair out of the corner of his eye
told him that Gina was also running toward the stage along side him. She
didn’t seem to have as much trouble keeping her balance as Ryan. He guessed
that her logical, well ordered mind could separate the conflicting sensations
more easily.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A pedestrian standing in his way was shoved clumsily
to the side. The man regained his balance and almost immediately stood
still once again, lost in the vision.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“And now I will cast a spell, in order to show you
the amazing spectrum of magical energies that, with these lenses, are now
visible to us,” Zertich continued. Ryan recalled how the Mancatcher and
other enchanted items had been dazzlingly brilliant in the Foundry. He
tried unsuccessfully to shield his eyes from what he knew was coming. A
flash and sparkle of swirling lights dazzled his eyes and he flinched away,
stumbling into a stall of perfumes and ointments.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The temporary construction of the stall could not
withstand the force of Ryan’s speed and bulk. It collapsed around him with
the sound of splitting wood and breaking glass. A hundred smells, both
sweet and pungent, entered his nostrils and curled his nose hairs. The
overwhelming odors served to bring him fully into his own body once again
though. He realized that Gina was pulling on his arm, trying to help him
to his feet. She held one hand firmly over her nose and mouth.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan climbed to his feet, crushing more bottles under
his boots. He and Gina resumed their run to the stage, where he could see
that they had erected a long counter against the front. He knew what was
behind it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I was so stupid!” Gina was saying. “Zirtech was
working for months on those experiments of his. Dozens of unacceptable
pieces in Corvex’ s studio. But we never saw a single finished piece! It
was all there in the invoices I read. Records of regular deliveries to
Annli Webspinner, regular deliveries from Corvex. It was all there, right
in front of my eyes!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan privately berated himself as well. Annli had
deceived him as easily as a Notary One. She had made him believe that her
nervousness came from revealing secrets about the Memory Stones. When he
had finally ‘convinced’ her to tell him about them, he had stopped pressuring
her for information. She had known all along about the lenses, had been
receiving them for months, and had said nothing. He should have known that
she wouldn’t have revealed any real darks of the Sensates. All that she
told him about the Memory Stones was probably only just true enough to
convince them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When they reached the stage, Gina angled towards
the steps which ran up it on either side. Ryan took a more direct route,
leaping up straight to the four-foot high platform.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mr. Wells. Is there something I can do for you?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan skidded to a halt on the wood. Standing before
him was Factol Erin Montgomery. He was as much shocked to see someone who
was not under the influence of the stones as to be suddenly confronted
by her beauty.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He saw a faint glimmer in her eyes and realized that
she was, in fact, being affected by the stones. He would have bet that
she was fully experien&shy;cing it too, and not just blocking it out for
his benefit.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You can’t sell those lenses,” Ryan said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin smiled dazzlingly. “On the contrary. I can and
most certainly will. These amazing little pieces of glass are going to
increase the value of our Memory Library a hundred-fold. The Sensates are
going to be brought closer to the Multiverse by leaps and bounds. Every
one who owns one of Zertich’s inventions will be taken forward to a whole
new level of insight. You will not deny us that.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina arrived at Ryan’s side. “There are creatures
out there,” she said, panting. “Creatures that can only be seen with those
lenses. As soon as they realize that they can be seen, they’ll kill anyone
who has one.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin shrugged, an act which made Ryan’s breath catch.
“There are dangerous creatures everywhere. If you look at a Tanar’ri the
wrong way, it might kill you just the same. Owners of the lenses will just
have to take responsibility for the dangers of using them.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“These creatures are not intelligent,” Gina said.
“They cannot be reasoned with or convinced that those who see them are
not a threat. More importantly, they are intangible as well as invisible.
They cannot be hurt or contained in order to protect people. You are going
to endanger the lives of more than just Sensates by doing this. These monsters
don’t just kill the person that sees them. They go berserk. There’s no
telling who they might injure or kill in the process of attacking the viewer.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As Erin was about to reply, Ryan saw the shimmer
fade from her eyes. He looked around and saw people coming out of the vision.
There was a deafening silence across the Promenade. It was the sound of
thousands of people trying to figure out the quickest way to get a lens.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Drawing his sword, Ryan turned from the Factol and
jumped to the counter which had been set up in front of the stage. He landed
on the wood at the same time that the assembled Sensates saw it and realized
what it was for. Ryan was hit by a wall of sound. Every single person there
wanted only one thing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As the first wave came toward him, Ryan swung the
sword in a threatening arc in front of him. Those at the front of the crowd
stumbled backward into those behind, who were still heading forward. Those
who were not knocked to the street were hit and driven down by the third
wave, who were then stumbled into by those behind them, and so on.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">After the confusion had subsided slightly, and those
in front had regained their feet, Ryan found himself looking into several
hundred pairs of angry, impatient eyes. Bracing himself, he shouted, “This
stall is closed!!” He was answered by a thousand outraged protests. Those
behind pushed forward again, and those at the front of the crowd dug in
their heels, eyes on Ryan’s still threatening blade.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“You cannot fight them all,” Erin said behind him.
Ryan winced. He had been hoping he would have a moment to wait for reinforcements
from the other Harmonium patrols before the rest of the crowd figured that
out. A murmur went through the crowd, carrying dangerous tones. At the
far end of the square, he could see a Harmonium patrol trying to make their
way toward him, but they would not make it before Ryan was overwhelmed
and dozens of lenses were distributed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan reached into his pocket and grasped the lens.
Endangering the Peace just to see a few new colors was unacceptable. He
withdrew the glass disc and looked at it, recalling a passage from the
<i>Book of Harmonium</i>.</font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial">‘Waging war in the name of Peace seems to
most to be a contradiction in terms. If we truly valued Peace above all
else, would we not wish to avoid wars and conflict? However, we do not
only wish Peace for our&shy;selves, but for everyone and the multiverse
itself. The Peace must be protected and ensured above all else.’</font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial">Ryan lifted the lens to his eye and looked through it.
There were three of the invisible monsters, one in the open space near
the stage and two others wandering around through the stalls. They walked
through the assembled crowd without care, drifting through people as if
they weren’t even there.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan took a deep breath and pointed to the nearest
one. “Hey, you!” he shouted. Several people in the general area looked
around, puzzled. A few answered uncertainly. The creature stopped moving
and Ryan felt the same uneasy sensation he had in the Foundry as it turned
its attention on him. He jumped up and down on the counter, waving his
arm. “Yeah, you! No wonder you’re invisible. I can barely stand to look
at you, you're so ugly! I’ve seen dretches with better complexions!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The creature screamed. Ryan gritted his teeth at
the sound. He had thought that the scream was one of rage or fear at having
been seen. A battle cry before going berserk. Looking through the lens
though, he now realized it was something else entirely. It was a warning.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The other two creatures stopped moving as well and
looked at him. They screamed together, the two sounds grating against each
other horribly. Ryan went cold. He had only meant to get the attention
of one. How was he going to face off against three?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“What are you doing?” Gina yelled from behind him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We can’t let these things be distributed,” Ryan
said. Men and women were picked up and thrown through the air as the creatures
made their way toward him. In the confusion of the crowd, Ryan took advantage
of the moment to look around hurriedly. One of the men behind the counter
had placed a box on the counter in anticipation of the sales. Ryan kicked
it to the street, where it splintered and was broken open.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Several lenses of different sizes and designs tumbled
out. Some looked as if they had been designed as magnifying glasses, while
others appeared as simple lenses like the one he held. Shoving his own
lens into his pocket, Ryan leaped down to the box, deliberately stepping
on and shattering any errant pieces. He tipped the box over, dumping the
rest of the glass to the street to crack or shatter. Then, seeing what
he was searching for, he dropped the box to catch a pair of glasses before
they hit the stone street. The box neatly crushed any surviving lenses.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan shoved the glasses on his face with one hand.
A few Sensates nearby too intent on acquiring the amazing lenses to be
distracted by the chaos behind them, shouted in anger at his destruction
of the objects of their desire. They only shouted louder when he put on
the glasses, seemingly keeping them for himself. Several blades were drawn.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Drawing his dagger with his other hand, Ryan backed
up against the counter as seven figures moved towards him threateningly.
Ryan suppressed a grin as he was reminded of the riot two years ago. “By
the authority of the Harmonium, you are ordered to disperse peacefully!”
he barked at the Sensates. They smiled at him, showing no intention of
following his commands. He hadn’t expected them to.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The first attack came from his left, as a bald tattooed
woman with a long sword lunged at him. He deflected the blade with his
dagger, using the sword in his right hand to knock back another from a
man trying to take advantage of the woman’s distraction. A third Sensate,
a half-ogre by the look of him, moved in from the front with a long spear.
The point of the spear caught him in the chest. Although his chainmail
protected him from being run through, the force of the blow drove him backwards
to tumble over the counter.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The clerks had already abandoned their posts. Underneath
the countertops Ryan saw rows of lenses, ready to be taken out and sold.
Standing, he took advantage of his position to kick into the shelves and
break several of the pieces. As he came into the view of the assailants
once again, he caught three blades on his own, raised to protect his neck
while it was at such a convenient level. The half-ogre stood directly in
front of him however, ready to thrust his spear through the space left
open by his raised swords. With the glasses, Ryan was able to see the attack
coming and dodged to the side. A sudden flash of light dazzled his now
incredibly enhanced eyes. The half-ogre was thrown back as three bolts
of energy sizzled into his chest. Ryan looked up briefly and saw Gina standing
on the edge of the stage above him. He then took advantage of the others’
surprise and struck out with his dagger, wounding the woman to his left.
She staggered back.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan reached down behind the counter and grabbed
another pair of glasses, throwing them up to Gina. “Put them on!” he yelled
at her before striking back another seeking sword point. A second sword
slipped past his defense and cut through his chainmail into his shoulder.
Ryan gritted his teeth against the pain and knocked the blade away.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Lunging out again, Ryan’s sword met with flesh, and
he dispatched another opponent. His left arm no longer worked properly
however, and another strike found its way through to his side. His chain
held better this time, making the potentially lethal blow only very painful
as it sliced shallowly into his skin. Ryan staggered back, dropping the
dagger in his left hand. He found himself looking up into the shadowed
eyes of the half-ogre once again. Although the burns on its chest looked
serious, it did not pay them any heed as it took careful aim with its spear.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Suddenly one of the creatures appeared behind it.
The huge humanoid found itself being lifted up mysteriously and flung backward
into the chaos of the panicked crowd. Ryan would have been happy if the
monster hadn’t been looking at him with murder in its strange beady eyes
the whole time. He scrambled to the side along the stage base, trying to
put distance between it and himself.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">A section of the counter was crushed as the monster
forced its way through the quickly assembled wood. Ryan noted with satisfaction
that many of the lenses were shattered as well. A huge arm lashed out and
struck Ryan full in the chest, sending him flying up and over the counter
into the open Square again. He landed with a grunt and rolled into a standing
position. The creature smashed its way through another section of the woodwork
as it pursued him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Behind you!” Gina shouted from the stage, wearing
the glasses Ryan had thrown her. Instinctively, Ryan spun, swinging his
sword at the threatener. He saw too late that it was another one of the
creatures. His sword flew through the intangible body before being caught
on the other side by one of the three-fingered hands. Already off balance
by the swing, Ryan could not hold on to the blade as it was yanked from
his grasp. He used the momentum of his fall to continue rolling however,
as two huge arms came down to strike the stone where he had stood a moment
before.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Pain shot through his shoulder each time it struck
the flagstones before he finally came up into a crouching position. He
saw with dismay that he was now fifty feet from the half-wrecked counter,
two monsters to his left and the third bearing down on him from behind.
Gina stood on the stage still, her hands moving in the motions of spellcasting
while vivid lights danced around her. The only other figure on the wooden
platform was Erin, all the others having retreated to a safe distance.
She stood, watching the action with an interested look on her face. Then
again, Ryan thought as he half-staggered, half-ran toward the counter,
the Sensate Factol probably would have expressed the same amount of an
interest in watching paint dry.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The area before the stage was almost completely deserted
now. All the Sensates had retreated to a save distance to watch the show.
He saw that Gina had finished casting her spell and was looking directly
at him, one hand gesturing in his direction and contorted in a complicated
gesture. Shimmering ribbons of bright color shot forth soundlessly and
enveloped him. Suddenly, Ryan’s legs put on a burst of speed. In shock,
he tripped over himself and fell, slamming into the counter head-fist.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Had the monster not already destroyed a third of
it, hitting the wood might have knocked him out. As it was though, the
weakened wood splintered under the impact and gave way. Bright flashes
which had nothing to do with magically enhanced vision appeared in front
of his eyes as Ryan struggled to his feet, using the edge of the stage
for support. The ground was tilting at a crazy angle as his vision swam.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina reached down and grabbed his wrist, pulling
up. “Come on!” she said urgently. “They’re almost here!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Imcomingimcoming,” Ryan was surprised to hear his
voice coming out as a rushed jumble of words. Leaning heavily against the
stage, he stumbled to where the counter met the platform. His legs were
still moving too fast for him to control and he found himself hitting the
counter and bending over it. Somehow he managed to get himself on top of
it and then from there to the top of the platform, where Gina and Erin
stood.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I’m so sorry!” Gina was saying as she tried to help
him to his feet. “I cast a haste spell so that you could get away from
them. I didn’t mean for you to trip like that.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Thatsokaywhatwerewedoingagain?” Through the ringing
in his ears, Ryan dimly heard the sound of more splintering wood behind
them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Come on!” Gina shouted, pulling him away from the
sound. Ryan tried to follow, but his legs were still moving too fast. He
stumbled ahead of the smaller woman and fell to his hands and knees.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mylegsdontworkright,” he mumbled, trying to get
to his feet.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Oh Gods, he hit his head too hard,” Gina said, trying
to support him.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Wells! Attenion!!” Ryan snapped to attention, his
sudden movement knocking Gina to the ground. “Snap out of it man! You are
a Harmonium soldier and you will act like it!”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yessir!” Ryan said vaguely. Consciousness rose up
from the surrounding daze that filled his mind and forcefully pushed away
the fuzziness trying to consume his thoughts. The flashing lights faded
and he found himself looking at Erin Montgomery. She was smiling.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“It’s really amazing sometimes what just the right
sensation can trigger inside us, don’t you think Mr. Wells?” she said.
“Now that you’ve rejoined us perhaps you could help with the matter at
hand?” She nodded toward the front of the stage.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked and saw the three monsters had mounted
the stage and were coming straight toward them. The one in the lead swung
a huge arm, forcing them all to duck. “We have to get away from them!”
Ryan said as they scrambled backward. “They’ll stop going crazy if they
can’t find us. It’s only when they feel threatened that they attack, and
we’re the threat.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Follow me,” Erin said. She jumped off the back of
the stage to the street and led them down the street to the nearby Civic
Festhall. Ryan, in his enhanced state of speed, had to concentrate on moving
slowly in order to not overtake the Factol as they entered the great doors.
If the building had been impressive before, now through the enchanted glasses
it was legendary. Every&shy;where Ryan had looked before, it had been as
if he could see through and beyond walls and objects and even people. But
here in the Festhall, he only felt as if he were seeing <i>more</i> of
what was around him. A marble wall, veined with gold, became a three-dim&shy;ensional
masterpiece as he looked through the stone at the waves and fingers of
the gold extending through it. The added colors only heightened the effect.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Factol ran to a white statue in the far corner
of the grand entry hall. It was a man, standing proudly nude and holding
a flaming bronze bowl above his head. The fire cast scintillating colors
on the nearby walls and floor. She reached up behind the man’s head and
felt around. “You’ll have to give me a moment,” she said as she traced
her fingers around the ivory curls. “The enchantment is so subtle that
I doubt you could even see it with those glasses you’re wearing.” Ryan
believed her. He couldn’t see anything particularly special about the statue
at all.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina grabbed his arm and he turned to see the invisible
monsters stalking toward them. It was unnerving how they made no sound
as they moved. The hall was completely quiet as the creatures neared them.
Any other monster would be growl&shy;ing threateningly or hissing, or making
any kind of sound. Somehow, the quiet was far more threatening than any
sound they could have made.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked back at Erin impatiently. “They’re all
most on top of us! How much-” He was cut off as Erin exclaimed in triumph.
Vivid colors which Ryan had come to associate with magic flooded in from
all directions, blotting out the entry hall. Then they withdrew as suddenly
as they had come, revealing a small study. Thick green carpet, similar
to that in her office, covered the floor and a large desk dominated the
room. It reminded Ryan strangely of Factol Sarin’s quarters, although it
was certainly a few dozen levels higher in the opulence scale.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin moved behind the desk and sat down leisurely
in the leather chair. “I keep a few Teleport spells linked to my personal
quarters in various places around the Festhall,” she said. “Just in case.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Perhaps you should take those off,” she suggested.
“You don’t really need them anymore.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan raised his hand to his face in surprise. He
had forgotten that he was wearing the glasses. Taking them off he was shocked
to find that he could no longer see through the walls and other objects
in the room. He was also slightly disappointed that he could no longer
see through cloth.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Mr. Wells, how long do you suppose that we will
have to wait before it is safe to return to the square?” Erin asked. “I
only ask because you seem to be bleeding quite a bit.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan looked down at his shoulder with surprise, having
forgotten about the injuries. He inspected the two wounds with a field
soldier’s eye and quickly determined that neither one was life-threatening.
He supposed that it might be worth going to a priest to have the shoulder
healed, other&shy;wise he might suffer in range of movement if it scarred
too badly. “I’ll be all right,” he said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Taking off his shirt and the chainmail underneath,
he revealed impressively muscled arms and chest. Tearing few strips from
his shirt, he quickly bandaged both wounds. Afterward, he redonned the
chainmail shirt and what was left of his outer shirt. Looking up, he was
uncomfortably aware of two sets of female eyes on him. “We should be able
to go down now,” he said in order to break the silence. “The creatures
lose interest after a few minutes, if the one in the Foundry was any clue.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina agreed and they both waited for Erin to stand
and open the door. She led them down a winding staircase. They came out
into a small hallway which quickly led them to the entry hall once again.
Ryan stood at the door and, wearing the glasses, made a quick survey of
the large room. There was only one creature there, and it did not seem
to be looking for them. Just to be safe, Ryan led the way. Once again,
Ryan used the same impassive face, keeping his attention on the creature
without actually looking straight at it. It did not appear to take notice
of them as they exited the hall and came back out into the street.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The area in front of the stage was still deserted,
although it was a much smaller area. The threat of invisible monsters still
lingered, in addition to the Harmonium soldiers who ringed the destroyed
stage, preventing the crowd from approaching. The three circled the destruction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">They stood in silence, surveying the ruins of splintered
wood and broken glass. “Our entire supply was in those boxes,” Erin said
sadly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“There are still a few left that haven’t been broken
yet,” Gina noted. Ryan surreptitiously trod on one of those few with a
kritch.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“But nowhere near enough to afford selling them to
the general populous,” Erin said. “With the designer dead and all of his
research lost, these few have just become extremely valuable. So rare that
from now on, they will be available to only to a select few. You have done
us a great disservice, Mr. Wells.” She turned to glare at the Harmonium
soldier.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan returned her glower. “If I hadn’t, your membership
would be short by a few hundred. And what happened to this stage would
have happened to the entire festival.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Erin nodded grimly. “And it is only because of that
I have not ordered your death.” She stepped forward and picked up one of
the unbroken lenses. Turning, she looked at Ryan through the glass before
sighing and placing it care&shy;fully back on the ground. “Perhaps it’s
all for the best,” she said finally.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Did you know that there are Sensates who have never
left Sigil? They rely entirely on the Memory Stones in our libraries for
new sensations and experiences. The Memory Stones, although invaluable
as a tool for many, have become a crutch for them. Who is to say whether
or not the same thing might have happened with these lenses?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I have known jewelers who have lost their sight
after years of looking through magnifying glasses. These lenses may have
done the same, only serving to dull our senses, rather than enhance them.
Some Sensates have honed their senses with such precision that they can
actually see a limited ways into what Zertich called the infravision range.
But would there have been a need to do so if they could have just lifted
a piece of glass to their eye instead?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Factol’s heel came down on the lens she had just
held, shattering it. “Perhaps your disservice was not so great after all,”
she said. “You may have in fact saved us from a great deal of trial.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She looked to the rest of the wreckage. “We will
of course keep the rest of these. There is no doubt that they are a useful
tool, if a dangerous one. Thank you, Mr. Wells. Although I would caution
you not to make meddling in the affairs of the Society of Sensation a habit.”
With that she turned and began giving orders to several of the guards to
come down and help gather up the remaining lenses.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan turned and limped with Gina back into the crowd,
which quickly parted to let them pass. The other Harmonium soldiers followed.</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">Factol Sarin cleared his throat as he stood before
the assembled Harmonium officers. “Well, the Festival of Sensation appears
to have gone very well, with the exception of one major incident, which
was contained and handled by Mr. Wells. He was able to prevent a major
breach in the Peace.” The Factol’s steely eyes looked down at Ryan where
he sat. “Well done Mr. Wells.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Ryan’s back straightened with pride as the eyes of
the entire assembly looked to him with respect. He almost forgot the myriad
of odors that still clung to his skin and hair, even after a dozen showers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“As to the matter with the Guvners,” Sarin continued.
“They’ve decided that they agree with me, and declared it too dangerous
for observers to accompany our patrols. Granted, it wasn’t quite the danger
I’d told them to expect, but the result is the same. It will be a long
time before they think about meddling around with keeping the Peace.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Luckily for those of us who have to deal with them
on a regular basis, they’re far more concerned with those observers they
sent to the Mercykillers to learn about their techniques in enforcing justice.
It seems that every one of them was arrested on various charges, most of
them involving interfering with carrying out justice on the prisoners.”
Several grins passed through the audience.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Factol held up what Ryan recognized as the agreement
the Fraternity of Order had sent them, the same one Factol Sarin had read
from a week ago. Sarin looked at a man standing at the side of the small
platform. “Claryok, if you would be so kind?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The man stepped forward and, spoke a few arcane words.
A bolt of fire arced from his outstretched hands and hit the packet, incinerating
it. A cheer went up from the audience. Sarin allowed the outburst to continue
for a moment before pounding once on the podium with a gauntleted fist.
Immediately, the auditorium fell quiet once again.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Now then,” he said once the echo had faded. “Let’s
get down to business.”</font>
<p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<p><font face="Arial">“Miss Hawpress, we’d like to thank you,” Kreager
said from behind the desk. Gina smiled and nodded to the two men and one
woman who sat opposite her in the small room. She had just finished a four-hour
interview as the three overseers went through her official report page-by-page
and questioned her on specific details. Kreager continued, “I know that
we’ve kept you here twice as long as the other observers, but I trust that
you understand our reasons for doing so.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gina nodded again. Her report was certainly more
interesting than the lists of infractions the overseers had received from
the other observers. It was also three times as long.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Voodrich folded her hands over the now closed booklet.
“It was a great surprise to us when we reached your report. Out of all
the observers, you appear to be the only one to have reported favorably
on the Harmonium. Why is that?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I will not deny that the Officer Wells committed
many infractions in his vigorous service to peace, as I am sure you discovered
in section two of my report,” Gina said. “However, as I observed the overall
result of his actions I came to realize that he was acting out of a desire
to better serve the Law.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She saw the overseers tense and quickly plunged onward.
“I am of course in no way condoning such actions. One obviously cannot
break the Law in order to serve it.” The overseers relaxed. “However, I
do not believe him to be the self-righteous bruiser that many of the other
observers described their charges as. To use a clich&eacute;, his heart
was in the right place.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Kreager nodded. “Yes, and we certainly cannot deny
the evidence of his results. Very well, Miss Hawpress. I believe we have
concluded our interview. I cannot fault your reasoning and in fact, I commend
you on it. Your Logic is quite clear. Thank you for your time.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Thank you sir,” Gina said as she stood and left
the small room.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Kreager waited until the she closed the door behind
her before speaking a single word. A rune appeared on the door, glowing
blue and signifying that the door was now magically sealed. He turned to
the other two overseers. “Your thoughts?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Voodrich pursed her lips and looked at the heavy
report. “I believe we may have to reevaluate our plans regarding the Harmonium.
Before coming to Miss Hawpress’s report I would have advised moving forward
as quickly as possible. The Harmonium seemed even worse than our original
projections. Now however, I must admit that they have their uses.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Lokin nodded his agreement. “It puts me in mind of
Dora’s theories on information assimilation. She proposes that there are
two forms of knowledge, to which all understanding can be ascribed. The
first is direct knowledge, which involves learning by a conscious effort
to understand. The second, and I believe the Harmonium fall under this
category, is indirect knowledge, which is obtained through experience and
heredity to become instinct. The Harmonium, through their service to peace,
have gained a great deal of indirect knowledge regarding Law enforcement.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We are in agreement then,” Kreager said. “We shall
recommend to the board that we postpone our plans in lieu of further inquiry
and study. Above all, we must be prepared for what we find before venturing
into unfamiliar territory.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Lokin picked up the pair of spectacles Gina had given
them along with her report. “What about this other matter?” he asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I looked up the snake she mentioned in the zoology
department of the library,” Voodrich said. “The behavior of the Melbrok
is almost identical to that of these invisible creatures. It is completely
benign until someone sees it and it feels threatened. With the lenses created
by Zertich almost all destroyed, the possibilities of more incidents are
remote. I have received reliable information that only two dozen were found
intact by the Sensates, making it likely that they will guard the rare
instruments jealously.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Lokin said, “Do you fault her interpretation of the
Law in acquiring them?”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Not at all. According to her report, Factol Montgomery
made no move to stop Officer Wells from taking his pair and did not ask
for them back after the disruption had ended. Since he also took this pair
and <i>then</i> gave them to her, we can assume that they were both gifts
to Wells. He merely made a gift of this pair to Miss Hawpress.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“I recommend that we form a new committee to study
these,” Kreager said. “As well as the creatures. The implications are very
great.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“We are in agreement,” Lokin said. “Although I will
advise that extreme precautions be taken to prevent any mishaps.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Do you agree with her final conclusion?” Voodrich
asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Of course,” Kreager said. “As I said, her Logic
is quite clear. At no time did Factol Montgomery utilize the lenses, yet
she reacted to the creatures as if she could see them just as Officer Wells
and Miss Hawpress could. And, had no one ever seen the kinds of things
Zertich’s lenses revealed, there would have been no need and no way to
hide that spell trigger in the statue from their enhanced range of vision.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Amazing,” Lokin mused as they all stood from the
table. “That the Factol could have actually fine-tuned her senses to such
an extreme that Zertich’s lenses were not necessary.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“Yes,” Kreager agreed, banishing the rune from the
door as they approached it. “Whatever happened to Officer Wells?” he asked
as he opened the door.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">“He was reassigned,” Voodrich said. “To the Hive.”</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Lokin shook his head sadly as they exited the room.
“You’d think they would want to reward such an exemplary man, not sentence
him to work in that cesspit.”</font>

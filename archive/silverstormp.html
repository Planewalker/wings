<p align=left>
	There was smoke and charred bodies everywhere, as far as the eyes 
could see.  Not an uncommon sight in the Gray Wastes, the preferred 
battleground for the Blood War. But he was not here to see the sights of "The 
Field of Nettles", he was here to find someone. Find some thing was more like it. 
He was not looking for a human or elf common enough on most crystal spheres; 
he was looking for the baatezu general "Bel." A Pit Fiend of uncommon ferocity 
and size and general of the baatezu offensive and, by the look of things, the 
victor in this latest of skirmishes.  
</p><p align=left>
	Walking with the skill and silence of the best of thieves schooled in this 
type of stealth Cinder Ebondorne' surveyed the devastation around him.  No 
matter how many times he saw these bloody battlefields it still shocked him to 
his core. 
</p><p align=left>
	But Cinder Ebondorne' was no thief, if anything he was a warrior of 
unmatched skill. His strength, speed, agility, and battle prowess had kept him 
alive these last ten years in the service of the baatezu, ten of his twenty five 
years of life. 
</p><p align=left>
	Standing just shy of six feet, with the lean stocky build of a warrior coming 
into his prime.  Equal amounts of elven and human blood ran through his veins. 
And he seemed to possess the best qualities of both. Long silver hair, which he 
usually kept tamed with a black ribbon, and charcoal colored eyes that were 
alive with mystery. His ears where sharp and acute as any surface elf.
Pulled from his observations by the telepathic link he and Frizar shared, 
he could see through Frizar's avian eyes they were only three miles from the 
baatezu encampment. Frizar circled once then easily glided down in his raven 
form to land on Cinder's shoulder, sinking his talons comfortably into Cinder's 
black leather armor.  Realizing the need for silence and stealth Frizar called to 
Cinder telepathically, "We be only three miles from Bel's camp, but there be 
many surviving tanar'ri nasties still out there. Some feeding on the bodies, 
others still looking for a fight."
</p><p align=left>
	"Let them come then," Cinder telepathically replied to Frizar.  "It has been 
a while since my blade has run red with tanar'ri blood." Cinder could sense the 
anticipation that Frizar felt towards such confrontation with his dreaded enemy 
the tanar'ri. And although Cinder felt no love toward the baatezu or the tanar'ri, 
he would never strike down a baatezu except in self-defense. For the result 
would be to devastating for him if his master Furcas ever found out. 
They continued their trek toward Bel's camp. Cinder could not believe that 
he would have ever gotten conformable with the smell and the pestilence of so 
many dead, but after ten years in the service of the baatezu - five years battling 
the tanar'ri themselves in this Blood War - one became almost numb to its 
effects. 
</p><p align=left>
	A mile and a half from the camp Cinder came upon the first signs of the 
enemy.  Frizar could hardly control his excitement for the battle he knew would 
soon come.  Cinder thought mentally to Frizar, "Go and let Bel know I will be 
there shortly." "But master Cinder!" replied Frizar verbally. Loud enough to give 
away any element of surprise that Cinder had gained through stealth. "Me want 
to help! Frizar stick bar-lgura good! You no make Frizar miss all de fun." What 
difference did it make now, thought Cinder. The three bar-lgura had already 
noticed Cinder's and Frizar's location because of the shouting and were already 
using their chameleon ability to disguise their location.  "When this meeting with 
Bel is over me and you are going to have a little talk again about controlling your 
excitement!" replied Cinder. "Frizar sorry master! Frizar not help it! Big ape 
headed bar-lgura make Frizar to excited! It bar-lgura's fault! You no blame 
Frizar."
</p><p align=left>
"We will argue this later! They move already to attack!" 
</p><p align=left>
The bar-lgura are lesser tanar'ri standing no more that five feet tall, but 
they are hulking brutes used by the tanar'ri lords for scouting assignments. Their 
long ape-like arms dragging the ground being used almost as much in 
movement as their short stout legs. 
</p><p align=left>
With his left hand Cinder pulled forth his short sword from its sheath he 
kept on his back, his dagger was out and ready in his right hand giving off a faint 
glow.  The closest bar-lgura advanced slowly forward, the other two held back, 
not sure what to make of their foe.  Such uncertainty from an enemy was very 
common to Cinder. Most of the fiends Cinder encountered had the ability to 
detect the true nature of other beings. Some could look into another's soul and 
sense the light or darkness that resided there.  And from Cinder the fiends most 
assuredly saw light with a tinge of chaos.  While the light was something that 
most fiends loved to corrupt, the chaotic nature of beings would usually mean 
that they would side with the unpredictable tanar'ri.  
</p><p align=left>
But as the bar-igura approached closer the dagger in Cinder's hand 
began to glow brighter and brighter.  A tell-tale sign that it was enchanted to 
inflict greater damage on a particular type of foe. This caused a deep grumble to 
come from the approaching bar-lgura and the two that held back.
Frizar launched itself from Cinder's shoulder circling some 100 feet above 
the two-rear bar-lgura.   At any other time Cinder would probably have been able 
to talk himself out of the coming conflict. But the message he carried to Bel was 
urgent and battle was quicker than parlay. 
</p><p align=left>
With a beastly growl the front bar-lgura jumped high into the air crossing 
over thirty feet in one leap. It bore down on Cinder feet first hoping to make 
quick sport out of him.  But Cinder was used to such tactics by the bar-lgura.  As 
quick as thought, Cinder rolled left causing the fiend to miss his target.  With two 
lightning fast strokes, dagger leading then short sword, Cinder tore into the face 
of the bar-igura.  The dagger hissed as it took out both the fiends eyes and it 
was followed by Cinder's short sword sinking half way into the bar-lgura's skull. 
Before the beast could even recover from its landing it was already dead on the 
ground, adding one more tanar'ri body to the littered battlefield. 
</p><p align=left>
The two remaining bar-igura looked at each other uncertainly after the 
display then slowly advanced on Cinder not willing to perform the leaping attack 
for fear of the same results. Their bodies' color shifting to match that of their 
surroundings creating an eerie effect as they advanced on their prey.
However, this time Cinder took the battle to them, not allowing the fiends 
to gain the advantage of a unified attack.  Keeping left, Cinder circled the larger 
of the two bar-lgura, charging in on the fiend with controlled ease. The bar-lgura 
swiped its five foot long arms ending in sharp wicked claws toward Cinder 
attempting both to maim and to bowl over its foe.  But Cinder leaped over the 
blow bringing down his short sword and dagger in unison in a overhand strike 
depositing both blades in the chest of the fiend.  Cinder left the hissing dagger in 
the fiends chest clogging it lungs. He then tore the sword forward splitting its 
other lung in a viscous downward path in the process of removing the blade. 
Cinder could hear Frizar's excited cawing as it attacked the eyes of the 
final remaining bar-lgura. But all the fight had run out of the fiend as it viewed 
the demise of its two mates. It bounded with all haste away from the raven and 
deadly warrior turning itself invisible on the fly. 
</p><p align=left>
"Let it go!" shouted Cinder to Frizar.  "Bel awaits our message." 
</p>

<p align=left>
  	Most sods will tell you there are few things in the multiverse that inspire 
greater fear than walking into the center of a baatezu war camp. One of these 
though is walking into a baatezu general's war tent unannounced. 
</p><p align=left>
	Cinder was very surprised by his acceptance into the ranks of baatezu 
when he first reached the edges of the army.  Although he had personally fought 
on the side of many of the fiends he encountered, more than five years have 
passed since he had done so.  Cinder suspected though to the immortal fiends 
all around him it seemed not so very long ago.  
</p><p align=left>
	"Our scouts tell us you had a little fun on your way here," replied a 
baatezu Cinder remembered being called "Grundlgar." 
</p><p align=left>
	"They were correct," replied Cinder. "And congratulations on your 
promotion, Lieutenant Grundlgar."
</p><p align=left>
	This brought a wicked grin to the baatezu face. 
</p><p align=left>
	"So `Cinder' you have come back to into our ranks with your sword and 
dagger already red with tanar'ri blood. That is good. I should also let you know 
that your record of 66 still stands."
</p><p align=left>
	Cinder could not help but grin himself at that.  It was baatezu custom to 
count the number of consecutive kills during a single battle.  Kills won without 
magical healing of any type to keep one going. To Cinder it was more a record of 
his determination to survive than any war record.
</p><p align=left>
	"I am sure the mighty Grundlgar has come closest to beating it," replied 
Cinder. A comment that brought another grin to the fiends' face.
</p><p align=left>
	"Have you come to rejoin our army? Or does Furcas have his `Agent of 
Stealth' here for another reason?" Grundlgar asked with a knowing glance. 
Cinder could tell that Grundlgar was very aware of the urgency of whatever 
message he held for Bel since this was the first time Cinder had been in his 
camp since he left the Blood War five years earlier.
</p><p align=left>
	"I have a message for Bel." Cinder replied. "It is very important I speak 
with him."
</p><p align=left>
	"Then you had better follow me. I am already late for a meeting with Bel 
and his other lieutenants." replied Grundlgar.
</p><p align=left>
	Using his telepathic link with Frizar, Cinder summoned him. The black 
raven landed lightly on his shoulder again drawing a third grin from Grundlgar's 
battle scared face. After making their way through a maze of Blood War soldiers 
they were finally in sight of the war tent. Cinder knew that if Bel was already in 
counsel with his other lieutenants there could be any number of warding magics 
already in place around the tent, so he fell back allowing Grundlgar to take the 
lead.
</p><p align=left>
 	If Grundlgar used any words or gestures to get past any magics that may 
have been active Cinder did not detect any. Grundlgar opened the entrance flap 
to the tent, holding it up for Cinder and a perched Frizar to enter. 
The interior of the tent that appeared no longer than twenty by twenty feet 
on the outside betrayed its actual size on the inside.  One would have thought 
that they were in a king's war room filled with lavish tables, chairs, maps, and 
tapestries hung everywhere. 
</p><p align=left>
	The second Cinder entered the room whatever discussion was underway 
ended immediately. Bel's and all five of his lieutenants looked towards the 
entryway to survey their new visitor.  Recognition showed in Bel's bloodshot 
eyes first then in the eyes of the other fiends that Cinder had fought along side 
five years earlier.  
</p><p align=left>
	As soon as Bel's eyes crossed Frizar's raven form the excited imp 
released his shape back into his natural form - shifting, shifting back into its true 
impish self. The little imp rubbed its hands together excitedly and without 
introduction or leave it said, "Oh great fiend general Bel, may I introduce master 
Cinder and myself, Frizar, yer most humble of servants." This brought a chuckle 
from all the fiends present with the exception of the annoyed Cinder. Frizar 
immediately sensed then his displeasure and was already preparing a string of 
excuses and apologies when Bel stood from his seat towering over even the 
largest of his lieutenants and said "Come little Friz, you will be my personal 
guest." Bel then lifted his arm in invitation. Frizar looked towards Cinder 
excitedly, then, after Cinder gave him a nod of agreement, the little imp flapped 
his bat-like wings until he was perched on the mighty fiend's arm.
</p><p align=left>
	It is a well-known fact that in the Nine Hells the Pit Fiends hold a certain 
reverence for their imp servants, their small impish minds mirroring their fiend 
lord's own in many ways. Cinder could no more have held back the little imp from 
his excited outburst than dam the River Styx.
</p><p align=left>
	After a short period of silence, in which Cinder was sure that Bel and 
Frizar were communicating telepathically, Bel looked back to Cinder and said. 
"Cinder, I see you still carry the dagger `Demonthorn' I gave to you seven years 
ago." 
</p><p align=left>
	"Yes and it has served me well these last five years in the service of 
Furcas." He replied.  
</p><p align=left>
	The dagger was forged eons ago for the sole purpose of slaying all things 
tanar'ri. It could inflicts great wounds in the chaotic fiends with the merest touch 
to tanar'ri flesh and it would also allow its wielder to see the true form and 
location of any tanar'ri holding a different shape than that of its natural form.  
The dagger was given to Cinder the day after he managed to single handily slay 
66 of the demon foes in one battle those seven years earlier. Given to him by 
Bel himself.
</p><p align=left>
	"So what news does Furcas bring to my war counsel this day?" asked Bel.
</p><p align=left>
	Getting straight to the point Cinder began to relay his message.
</p><p align=left>
	"What we feared when I was among your legions has finally come to 
pass." Said Cinder in somber tones. "The tanar'ri have completed the creation of 
their Ships of Chaos."
</p><p align=left>
	This brought the council into dead silence. Fear was evident even in the 
eyes of Bel. 
</p><p align=left>
	"Illssender now has at least ten such ships ready for battle. Each capable 
of holding no less than 500 tanar'ri."
</p><p align=left>
	If there was truly any among the tanar'ri that rivaled Bel in power and 
battle skill it was Illssender. He was a balor general of incredible size and fury, 
preferring to wade into the middle of any Blood War battle and fight along side 
the lowest of manes than let them hog all the blood and glory.
</p><p align=left>
	Cinder could sense the fury rising in Bel, and even the adoring Frizar took 
a step away from the pit fiend's side fearing his wrath.
</p><p align=left>
	"And how has Furcas come by this intelligence?" asked Bel, using all his 
formidable will to control his mounting anger.
</p><p align=left>
	"By my own eyes, general Bel. I have spent the last two weeks scouting 
the area around his tower on the 313th layer of the Abyss. And as you know, it is 
difficult for the lesser tanar'ri to hold any secrets for too long. And Demonthorn 
has a way of making the most stubborn of demon sods loosen their tongues."
</p><p align=left>
	Bel's mental image of the tanar'ri interrogations Cinder had probably 
performed to gain this intelligence brought the slightest of smiles to his face and 
the tension present in the room loosened ever so slightly.
</p><p align=left>
	"Then I take it Dagos is aware of this also?" asked Bel.
</p><p align=left>
	"Yes. Furcas has dispatched messengers to Dagos's and all of his 
generals and to all members of the Dark Eight." Replied Cinder. "But he sent me 
personally to you; knowing the rivalry between you and Illssender, he figures 
your army will be the tanar'ri general's first target."
</p><p align=left>
	"He was right in thinking so." replied Bel. "Now let's get down to specifics, 
Cinder." 
</p><p align=left>
	Cinder knew he was in for the interrogation of his life, and by the time Bel 
finished with him he would be wishing he was just another soldier of the Blood 
War and not one of Furcas' Agents of Stealth.

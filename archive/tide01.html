	"Wait here, templar."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion took a moment to examine himself in the small mirror which hung on the
near wall.  His long hair was tousled and his clothing was in disarray.  He had
been roused in the dead of night, and had no time to properly prepare for an
audience with the prophet.  He had pulled on some breeches and his boots, slung
the tabard of the Order over his underclothes, and snatched up his sword,
buckling it to his hip on the way.</p><p align=left>
	He was a handsome man, barely into his mid-twenties and in excellent physical
condition.  His face was strong, and framed by long dark blonde hair which hung
down past his shoulders.  Perhaps surprisingly, considering the amount of
combat he had seen, it was unmarked by scars of any kind.  His eyes were a
piercing blue, intense and arresting.</p><p align=left>
	Hurriedly he did what he could, raking his fingers through his hair and
smoothing his clothes.</p><p align=left>
  	"This way, templar," said the guardsman, returning.  "He will see you immediately."</p><p align=left>
	Quickly he was ushered from the antechamber to the inner chambers.</p><p align=left>
	The Chambers of the Prophet were softly lit with oil lamps.  Within there was
a general air of confusion as guardsman and officers rushed about, issuing
reports and orders.</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion had never visited the chambers of the prophet at night before.  No-one
had.  The prophet, on those rare occasions when he summoned guests to his
personal chambers, never admitted them after dark.  It was a precedent that had
not been broken in a thousand years.</p><p align=left>
	Surely this is a matter of grave urgency, he thought.</p><p align=left>
	Great Father Lyandorus Hyeth, prophet of the one true God, stood in the center
of the room, surrounded by aides.  He was an older man, well into his
seventieth year, yet he was unmistakably healthy and vigorous.  He looked like
he had been roused from his sleeping chamber not long before Gwydion was, but
did not appear flustered or harried.  Instead, he seemed serious and
determined.</p><p align=left>
	His eyes locked with Gwydion's as he entered.</p><p align=left>
	"Leave us," the prophet commanded.</p><p align=left>
	There were hurried bows, and quickly the room emptied.</p><p align=left>
	The prophet regarded Gwydion for a moment before speaking.  "Gwydion, high
templar of God."  He gestured for the young knight to approach.  	Swiftly
Gwydion stepped forward.  "Holy father," he said, kneeling respectfully.</p><p align=left>
	"Rise my son," said the prophet, "I'm afraid we don't have time for ceremony.
Tragedy has struck.  You have been told?"</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion shook his head.  "I was but recently roused from my bed, holy
father."</p><p align=left>
	The prophet sighed.  "It is very serious, Gwydion.  The great seal has been
breached."</p><p align=left>
	For a moment, Gwydion was not certain he had heard the prophet correctly.  The
great seal breached!  "But that is impossible!  The seal cannot be opened from
the other side!"</p><p align=left>
	"Yes, so it has always been thought"  The prophet sighed, weary, and suddenly
Gwydion saw the weight of the years pressing down on the man.  "Evidently there
was some treachery involved.  But it is worse than simply a matter of something
from the worlds beyond passing through the seal.  The Icon has been taken."</p><p align=left>
	"The Icon?"</p><p align=left>
	The old man nodded.  "It must be recovered, Gwydion.  I don't have to tell you
how important it is.  How dangerous it can be in the wrong hands."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion nodded.  The Icon was more than a relic.  It was the greatest of the
seven great artifacts.  He knew well that it held unimaginable power.</p><p align=left>
	The prophet laid a hand on his shoulder.  "You must journey to the worlds
beyond, and retrieve the Icon."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion was confused.  "The worlds beyond?"</p><p align=left>
	"Yes," said the prophet, nodding.  "The Icon was taken there.  I am sending
you to get it back."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion's mind was reeling.  The worlds beyond!  "But I know nothing of the
worlds beyond, great father," he protested.</p><p align=left>
	"You were schooled in the Order, Gwydion.  You are as educated on their nature
as any other.  More than most.  No man knows the ways of the worlds beyond.
You are as prepared as you can be."  	"But why me, father?  I am not worthy of
this."</p><p align=left>
	The prophet gave him a somber look.  "God has spoken, my son.  We are not to
question.  He has gifted you with abilities beyond your knowledge.  You were
chosen before you were born."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion was overcome with a feeling of deep inadequacy.  "But I am no scholar,
father.  I have only basic knowledge of what manner of things lie in the realms
beyond.  Surely I am an unworthy vessel for such a task.  I am only a loyal
soldier of God."</p><p align=left>
	The prophet shook his head.  "A soldier is what is needed, not a scholar."</p><p align=left>
	"Then why not an army?" Gwydion insisted.  "Surely one soldier is not equal to
the task."</p><p align=left>
	"Perhaps one man may prevail where a dozen armies would fail.   I will not
mislead you.  The path ahead is perilous.  But you have been selected and
prepared  for this task by God.  Will you second-</p><p align=left>
guess Him?  Do not underestimate yourself.  You are the finest blademaster the
Order has ever produced.  Was it not you who, not three years past, managed to
cross the Jaggenoth Mountains and penetrate deep into enemy territory during
the War of the Abominations?  Did you not pass through the most inhospitable
terrain during the deepest and bitterest part of winter, and enter a land where
every man's hand was against you?  And did you not face these conditions alone,
and yet prevailed?"</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion shook his head, unconvinced.  "That was against the elements, and men.
There are demons and worse in the worlds beyond, father."</p><p align=left>
	"There is nothing beyond which cannot be overcome by faith in God, my son.
Trust in him.  He will provide a way.  You have the gift of tongues, Gwydion.
I have seen this."</p><p align=left>
	That was true.  All his life Gwydion had had the talent.  He could understand
languages as if he were born to them.  There was no man nor beast which he
could not understand.  Yet this seemed a small gift indeed, in the face of the
mission he was being asked to accept.</p><p align=left>
	"Do not underestimate its worth," said the prophet, reading the skepticism in
Gwydion's eyes.  "It is a divine talent, and will serve you better than you
know."</p><p align=left>
	"I... I fear, father," Gwydion said, casting his eyes down in shame.  "I fear
that I may fail.  Your faith in me is misplaced."</p><p align=left>
	"God chose you, my son.  My faith in him is not misplaced.  But you must
decide.  Will you go?  I cannot force you."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion looked up, then knelt again, drawing his sword.  "I will serve my
God," he declared, making an oath on his sword as was the custom.  "I swear to
it."</p><p align=left>
	He stood again, and suddenly the doubt was gone from his eyes, replaced by
determination.  "How soon before I leave?"</p><p align=left>
	"This very night.  You will have one companion, a scholar called Theodric.
You are familiar with the man?"</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion shook his head.  "I have not heard the name."</p><p align=left>
	"No matter.  He is a good man - I trust him.  And he is very well versed in
what little lore we possess of the lands beyond.  He will aid you on your
journey.  I'm afraid he isn't a fighting man, </p><p align=left>
however."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion nodded.  "Then I shall protect him.  How will we journey to the worlds
beyond?"</p><p align=left>
	 "Through the great seal.  We shall open it a second time tonight, and you
will go through it."  The prophet made his way to a nearby desk, and lifted a
long object wrapped in fine cloth.  "Give me your sword, Gwydion."</p><p align=left>
	The young man was momentarily taken aback.  "My sword?"</p><p align=left>
	"Yes, you will not be needing it."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion unsheathed his sword slowly, and surrendered it.  "I am to travel to
the worlds beyond without a weapon?"</p><p align=left>
	The prophet shook his head.  "You will be armed with this."  Carefully he
unwrapped the long object.  As the wrappings fell away, a magnificent
two-handed sword was revealed.</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion gasped.  "Tylith-senshai!" he breathed in awe.</p><p align=left>
	"Indeed," said the prophet.  "It would have been a great blow if we had lost
this tonight.  Thank God in his mercy that we did not."</p><p align=left>
	Tylith-senshai was another of the seven great artifacts.  It was much more
than a sword.  It was said that its wielder could perform feats undreamed of.</p><p align=left>
	The prophet held it forward.  Gwydion stepped back, suddenly afraid.  Only the
pure in heart could touch Tylith-senshai.  Its touch was death to anyone who
was not worthy.</p><p align=left>
	"It will serve you well," prompted the prophet, sensing Gwydion's
nervousness.</p><p align=left>
	Gently Gwydion took hold of the handle.  A surge of energy coursed up his arms
as his palms wrapped around the hilt.  It was light, much lighter than a sword
its size had a right to be.</p><p align=left>
	"Here," indicated the prophet, turning the sword point-down so that Gwydion
could see the pommel.  Within the pommel was set a small clear crystal of
curious workmanship, that appeared very like a compass.  Within the crystal was
a golden piece of metal.  "This is the thummim.  It will point towards the
Icon."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion examined it for a moment.  "But it is sitting there, limp, on the
bottom."</p><p align=left>
	"That is because the Icon is not on our world.  When you enter the same
reality as the Icon, this will guide you to it."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion looked up at the prophet.  "Great father, who has taken the Icon?"</p><p align=left>
	The prophet shook his head.  "I have worked knowing after knowing, but those
who came from the other side have covered their trail well.  I cannot pierce
their sorceries.  We have only the spirits of our own dead to tell us what
happened, and they are bound against revealing too much.  I have only the
vaguest of details.  Come."</p><p align=left>
	The prophet laid his hands on Gwydion's head.  With a jolt, the prophet
performed his miracle, working the clerical magic to form an image in Gwydion's
mind.</p><p align=left>
	With a jolt, Gwydion realized he was seeing through a dying man's eyes.  There
were demons - legions of them, tearing the man and others like him asunder.
And... there was a man.</p><p align=left>
	Or something that walked in the form of a man.  There was something inhuman in
beauty of the man's face, in the way he flowed rather than walked....</p><p align=left>
	And then, just as suddenly, the vision was gone.  But the memory remained -
the imprint of the man's face.  And Gwydion knew that this was the one who had
taken the Icon.</p><p align=left>
	"Great father," said  Gwydion, "I must know everything."</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
***</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
	The Inner Sanctum, chamber of the Great Seal, was not nearly so grand as
Gwydion had expected it to be.  In truth it was a fairly small room, only about
twenty paces across, oval in shape, and less than fifteen feet in height.  The
walls and ceiling were of white marble, unmarred by windows or doors (other
than the entrance) and bare of ornamentation.  Inscribed on the floor was a
curious pattern enclosed within a circle.</p><p align=left>
	What exactly that pattern was Gwydion couldn't tell, because it, most of the
floor, and a good part of the walls were covered with blood and human
remains.</p><p align=left>
	The gigantic iron double doors which had once sealed the room were now little
more than twisted and misshapen metal.  They had been torn from their hinges
and flung forcibly out into the hallway beyond.</p><p align=left>
	"There were two guardsman stationed within the room and two in the hall
without," said the young captain, escorting him into the room.  "Whatever
killed them did it fast.  The ones outside the room didn't make it ten yards
down the hall before they were taken."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion entered the chamber, looking around.  There were a few other guardsmen
there, though exactly what they were doing was open to debate.  Mostly they
seemed to be waiting around, doing nothing.  Behind them, hovering nervously,
stood a skinny man with overlarge spectacles and a gigantic pack on his back.</p><p align=left>
	Carefully Gwydion crossed the room, taking care in where he set his feet.  The
floor was a gruesome sight, strewn with blood, gore, and human body parts.</p><p align=left>
	"That's Yendril," offered the young captain, noticing where Gwydion's
attention lay, "one of the two guards who were stationed inside the chamber.
There wasn't much left of him.  So far, we haven't found anything larger than a
thumb.  Something tore him up pretty good  Truth to tell, we're not really
certain that it is Yendril.  It's just that we found one of his rings.  It
could be Nessuth, the other guard."  	"Perhaps it's both."</p><p align=left>
	The other man shrugged.  "Maybe.  Don't think so though.  There aren't enough
pieces."</p><p align=left>
	"Gwydion Talienvar?" asked the skinny man, darting forward and clasping
Gwydion's hand firmly.  "I am Theodric Aleskian.  I believe I am to accompany
you."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion nodded, looking the man over.  "Well met."  The prophet had been
correct when he had said that this man was a scholar rather than a warrior.
Theodric was a middle-aged man, possibly in his late thirties, with an
overlarge nose (on which the spectacles were precariously perched) and short
brown hair.  He projected an air of awkwardness, as if he had never really
gained control of his elongated limbs.  He was tall, and Gwydion wondered with
the enormous pack on his back whether the man might actually overbalance and go
sprawling.  "What's that on your back?" he asked.</p><p align=left>
	Theodric was momentarily surprised.  "My back?  Oh, you mean the backpack.
That's supplies.  Provisions, in the main.  You see, no-one is really certain
whether there is consumable food in the universes beyond.  It is known that
humans can survive there, at least for a time.  There are records of heroes
journeying there in the past, and staying for some time.  But it is unclear
whether they found that the food there was edible or whether they simply
brought stores along.  Perhaps there is even some quality of the worlds beyond
that enables mortals to exist without sustenance of any kind.  There is quite
some debate on the subject, really."  	Gwydion nodded.  "Better to be safe."</p><p align=left>
	"Oh, unquestionably.  Unquestionably."  The tall man suddenly slipped on the
blood-slickened floor, and he nearly did overbalance.</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion caught hold of the man's robes, steadying him.</p><p align=left>
	"Thank you, templar Talienvar," offered Theodric, looking embarrassed.</p><p align=left>
	"Please call me Gwydion."  	"Oh, forgive me."  Theodric readjusted his
spectacles, which had nearly tumbled from his face.  "I see you carry something
on your back as well."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion glanced back to where the hilt of Tylith-senshai jutted up over his
left shoulder.  Normally he wore his blade at his side, but the great sword was
too long and he had ended up slinging it over his back.  "Yes," he said, "it
may prove useful as well."</p><p align=left>
	He glanced around the room.  "Where is the portal?"</p><p align=left>
	"Actually," said Theodric, "you're standing on it."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion looked down.  "The pattern?"</p><p align=left>
	"Exactly."</p><p align=left>
	"How does it work?"</p><p align=left>
	"Well, that's my field of expertise, actually."  The tall man pulled off his
pack, set it on the floor, and rifled through it quickly.  A moment later he
drew out a small blue piece of crystal.  "This is the key.  With it, I can
unlock the seal and open the portal.  Well, theoretically at least.  It hasn't
been done for ten thousand years."</p><p align=left>
	"Can the portal be opened without the 'key'?"</p><p align=left>
	Theodric shook his head.  "No.  It takes this key specifically.  Without it,
we won't be entering or returning the worlds beyond."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion considered.  "Where does the portal lead?"</p><p align=left>
	"Unknown.  Remember, no-one has used it in ten thousand years.  The reports we
have of those who used it are sketchy at best.  We cannot even be certain which
of the universes it leads to."</p><p align=left>
	"Then there is no way to prepare for what lies beyond?"</p><p align=left>
	Theodric shrugged.  "I'm afraid not."</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion sighed.  "Well, there's no sense in delaying.  The sooner we go the
better.  How long will it take you to open the portal?"</p><p align=left>
	"Not long," assured the tall man.  "Please, everyone, move back.  Out of the
circle please."</p><p align=left>
	The remaining guardsman, the captain, and Gwydion all quickly stepped back.</p><p align=left>
	Theodric examined the pattern for a moment, then walked to the center.  He
stooped, placing the crystal key on the floor, then stood, considering.  After
a moment he stepped back, then turned and stepped out of the circle.</p><p align=left>
	He waited expectantly.</p><p align=left>
	"Nothing's happening," said Gwydion after a long moment.</p><p align=left>
	"Give it time."</p><p align=left>
	They waited.</p><p align=left>
	Just when Gwydion was about to comment again, the crystal key shifted.
Slowly, as though it were sinking into mud, the key began to sink into the
floor.</p><p align=left>
	"What the..." muttered the captain from behind Gwydion.</p><p align=left>
	A moment later and the key had completely submerged.  There was a moment of
stillness.</p><p align=left>
	"I'm not really certain that was supposed to happen," said Theodric.  "I do
hope we haven't lost the key."</p><p align=left>
	With a roar, a streak of dazzlingly bright light erupted from the center of
the pattern, and Gwydion reeled back, throwing his arm up to shield his eyes.</p><p align=left>
	The light grew brighter still, and a wind was suddenly coming from it, blowing
stiffly against them.  "Is it supposed to do that?" asked Gwydion, yelling to
be heard over the roar.</p><p align=left>
	"Not sure," Theodric yelled back.</p><p align=left>
	Gradually the dazzling light dimmed, until it was possible to look at it with
the naked eye.  A swirling vortex of white light had formed in the very center
of the pattern.</p><p align=left>
	"Is that the portal?" asked Gwydion.  "How do we use it?"</p><p align=left>
	"Just step through," yelled Theodric.</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion stared at him.  "Is it safe?"</p><p align=left>
	"Who knows?"</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion took hold of the scholar's arm and started forward.  "Right then.
Let's go!"</p><p align=left>
	He paused, just in front of the portal, trying to see into its swirling
depths, then stepped through.</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
***</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
	Complete darkness.  Blinding light.</p><p align=left>
	Suddenly Gwydion was trapped in the middle of nowhere.  He was blind.  He was
deaf.  He was utterly alone.</p><p align=left>
	And he was in excruciating pain.</p><p align=left>
	He reached out with arms, but they were not his arms.  He flailed out with
legs, but they were not his legs.</p><p align=left>
	Where am I?</p><p align=left>
	And the pain!  He was slowly being ripped apart.  His arm felt like it was
being ripped from the socket.  Slowly.</p><p align=left>
	And suddenly, he knew.  The portal was trapped!  He may not have understood
how it had been done, or how the trap functioned, but he realized it's
effect.</p><p align=left>
	He was experiencing first hand the death of another man!</p><p align=left>
	No wonder they hadn't found the second guard's body!  The intruders had taken
it here, into the portal, to serve as a deathtrap for any who tried to
follow.</p><p align=left>
	Already he was beginning to lose awareness of self, beginning to merge with
the spirit of the slain man.  The pain of death was becoming more pronounced,
more real.</p><p align=left>
	Instinctively he knew that if he lost awareness of self, he would die for
real.</p><p align=left>
	I am Gwydion!</p><p align=left>
	But he was Nessuth, being torn to pieces by demons from a nightmare.  He could
hear it.  He could see it.  He could smell it.  He could feel it.</p><p align=left>
	His struggle was in vain.  Already the reality of Nessuth's demise was
beginning to override the reality of self.</p><p align=left>
	No!  No!  No!</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion realized he was going to die.</p><p align=left>
	Then, just as the struggle for self was ending, and Gwydion had nearly
abandoned himself to death, he found something deep within to hold onto.  He
was a servant of God!</p><p align=left>
	And Gwydion began to pray.</p><p align=left>
	Oh God, have mercy on me!  Deliver me!</p><p align=left>
	And God answered.  Immediately Gwydion felt a new surge of strength enter his
being.</p><p align=left>
	It was still difficult, but slowly Gwydion fought his way free of Nessuth, and
that reality.  He struggled as a man who is deep beneath the water struggles
for air, striving for the surface.</p><p align=left>
	The surface that was so close... so close... so very close...</p><p align=left>
	And then Gwydion was free, and had broken the surface to another universe.</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
***</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>
	In the middle of a vast, empty plain stood a wide black set of granite stairs
that lead to nowhere.  Ten feet above the landing at the top of the stairs, a
hole opened in the fabric of space and time, and a man tumbled out.</p><p align=left>
	It closed behind him.</p><p align=left>
	Gwydion picked himself up unsteadily, then pitched forward headlong down the
stairs.  At the bottom he fell to his knees, vomiting.</p><p align=left>
	After a moment his stomach stopped heaving.  He glanced back the way he had
come, to the top of the stairs.  The landing was empty.  I am alone!  Theodric
must have succumbed to the trap!  Without him, how will I return?</p><p align=left>
	"Well," said a feminine voice from behind him, "you're not exactly cut out for
planar travel are you, cutter?"</p>

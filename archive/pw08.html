We've been on the waste for a week. Still haven't found Bane. The men
are getting more and more anxious. Bane led them, and then he abandoned them.
Perhaps if I sacrifice him to Xvim, he will reward me with more power. My Mace
of Strife was unable to slay him like it did his betraying cohort. You can't
trust mages anyhow. Rodan was hungry for flesh, he thinks he can beat Bane in
one on one. I know better, he's fast, I have killed my share of fighters, and
it was only the will of  Xvim that saved me from death.  Xvim came to me and
told me it was his sword, the Fiendslayer, is what healed Bane, and allows him
to be a more fearsome opponent. From further scrying I found that he isn't
alone, there seems to be two other humanoid creatures with him. Could be
half-elves, could be tieflings. Doesn't matter, they will all die. </p><p align=left>

It's reported by an Arcanoloth who visited our party, that the fiends that were
sent after Bane, were killed, but that he sent the three: Bane, a Wind Duke and
a Sea Queen, to their doom. He gave them a teleporter to the third gloom where
lurks an adult Red Dragon, who should put all three of them in the dead book.
We paid the fiend five thousand gold for a teleporter to take us to what should
be the end of that foolish Blood Warrior. We were teleported just outside a
cave where the dragon lurked, and we could already see who won the battle. A
large dragon carcass laid out on the ground.  Impossible! We examined the body
and found a number of sword slashes, and the puncture that ended the fight in
this Wyrm. His sword must be a Frost Brand, blades created to slay fire
dwelling creatures. This is the only thing that could explain why he can easily
destroy fiends now and put this creature in the dead book.</p><p align=left>

One of the men called from inside the cave. I put my hand to my mace. Please
Xvim, let that betraying fool be there. Inside the cave there was what was left
of the dragons treasure, a huge number of coins, but it looks like that fiend
killer had collected a good portion of the treasure. If the creature had
stockpiled any magical items, they are all gone. The group was nowhere to be
seen, and no corpses were here, so they slain the dragon without a death among
them. The men started collecting coins, and they found tracks leading out of
the cave, and then they stop. There were three tracks, one I knew were the
tracks of Bane, his green steel boots were unmistakable. My mace would taste
his blood if it is the last thing I do. Two other set of footprints were there,
must be of those loathsome Gensai I heard about. They will die too by my hand.
Where did they go? I must divine with my god.</p><p align=left>

"Oh Xvim, " I chant, hold the power key, my powerful black lord gave to me.
"Grant me insight on where those loathsome cutters are!" I continue to chant as
my troops fill their bags with gold. My chants grew louder. If it wasn't for my
power key, I would get a bleak view of our future, all of us dead by the blade
of the coward. "Iyachtu Xvim, I, Xrist, your faithful servant demands that you
tell me where they are!" My eyes widened in shock as a large pair of green eyes
appeared before me. A voice sliced into my mind. "You demand of me, you worm?"
Oh how truly blessed, my lord came personally to answer my augury. "The mortal
in question is powerful, only my might will help you against the planetouched
individual. He is in Sigil, and he radiates an aura that is not of any Prime
worlds I know, if he is from a Prime world, it was from one that opens once in
a lifetime." </p><p align=left>

I called to my God "What should I do my lord?" Please let me kill him! "I want
to interrogate him myself, fail me and you will meet my wrath, and you soul
will wither up on Gehenna, and you'll be sold to a fiend and eaten alive. Damn
it, I want to kill the berk!  Xvim's green eyes flared "Don't fool yourself
Xrist, he is a much better warrior than you. Use the power I grant you to
capture him, then I will send an avatar to collect him."  I grimaced "Where is
he at lord Xvim? Is he still here on the Waste?" My dark lord replied "No, Bane
has left the Waste to a portal that leads to Sigil, you must go there and bring
him back to Gehenna, where my proxy will collect him. You fail, or kill him,
and you'll wish he killed you in that first battle.." The Dark Lord's eyes
closed and his presence left me. I wouldn't fail my lord. If I don't kill him,
someone else could, yes..... he never said that... I'll see Bane's corpse yet.
When the men finish, I command them to lead the way to the gate to Bedlam, then
from there, to Sigil.</p><p align=left>

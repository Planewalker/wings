<p align=left>
Ten long years. Every day seemed like an eternity of torture to Cinder.  Had it really been that long.  His 
thoughts were in the past as he strolled through the marketplace in Sigil the City of Doors. Like every day 
for the last five years Frizar was perched on his shoulder in raven form invading his thoughts for any 
signs of treachery so it could report back to Furcas. Theirs was a love-hate relationship, Cinder hated 
Frizar and Frizar seemed to love that.
</p><p align=left>
Cinder picked up his pace a little. The last thing he wanted to do was to be late for his visit with his sister.
</p><p align=left>
How he loved "Springrite." It was the one day every year for the last ten years when Furcas allowed him 
to meet with his enslaved sister. 
</p><p align=left>
Cinder had long ago quit feeling sorry for his plight. For as bad as his life had become it was nothing 
compared to the one that Ellenestra his beautiful sister was living. The day of their capture and of his 
fathers murder seemed to play through his thoughts as fast as Frizar could pluck them out.
</p><p align=left>
Cinder could hear Friz's mental sigh as he yet again revisited in his memories that fateful day ten years 
earlier.

Like every Springrite, for the last ten years that he had spent in the High Forrest on the crystal sphere 
called Toril, Cinder was helping his Moon-Elven  father Tantteer Ebondorne' and his half-sister 
Ellenestra prepare for the festival. This day belonged first to Rillifane Rallathil the Leaflord, elven god of 
woodland realms and second to those faithful elves that followed his ways. To the druids and rangers 
among the faithful this was a day of joyous revelry. Song, dance, and drinking rare and potent elven 
spirits, were among the more pleasant of diversions a fifteen year old half-elf could indulge in.  And for 
Cinder, who had only two weeks earlier been excepted as a true warrior among his people despite his half 
human heritage, he could think of no greater joy than being among his family and friends.  If only his 
mother the Lady Austriel of Silverymoon could have broken away from her courtly obligations to attend.  
</p><p align=left>
His mother had raised him to the age of five in Silverymoon when she allowed his father Tantteer, a 
ranger of incredible skill, to take him away from the safety of Austriel's beloved city into the dangerous 
wilderness of the High Forrest. But, to a five-year old that looked up to his accomplished father, he was in 
heaven.  Tantteer taught him the ways of his elven ancestors: archery, swordsmenship, woodcraft, and 
stealth "to become a leaf among a forest of leaves," as his father used to say. He did not take to the ranger 
skills as highly as he did the ways around a sword and dagger. But now at fifteen there were few among 
even the most skilled fighters and rangers of his village that could hold back his short sword and dagger 
in combat. And his strength was increasing daily a gift from his mother's human side that the fey folk 
could not match. 
</p><p align=left>
He had downed his tenth glass of elven wine. Even the most stout among his people would be on the 
ground unconscious, and many were, by now. But the revelry had continued all through the day and long 
into the night. Even a few  Centaurs and come to join in on this joyous occasion. 
</p><p align=left>
His sister was glaring at him again with her disapproving emerald green eyes.  Ellenestra was as a pearl 
among stones, outshining even the most beautiful of elven maids. Ten years his elder and born to a Green 
Elven mother that died during her birth Ellenestra was entirely to sobering for Cinder.  He too often 
indulged on spirits and other types of mischief for her liking. And Cinder thought so highly of her that he 
felt real guilt when she reminded him of his excess. She had never belittled his half-elven blood like so 
many of his rivals had. She only showed caring and concern for him and his father.
</p><p align=left>
The full moon was at its zenith when the first gate appeared less than a quarter of a mile from the 
festivities. The beast that emerged from the dark portals were Baatezu (Devils) and theirs was a mission of 
slaughter and slavery.  They numbered more than forty led by a nine foot tall Cornugon named 
Knuckmar. And they followed a plan of assault and murder practiced on hundreds of worlds. 
</p><p align=left>
Normally it would be virtually impossible for any invaders to approach within ten miles of the elven 
village without notice by their scouts, but even the guardians of the village were allowed a night off to 
participate at the mid summers eve festival.  
</p><p align=left>
The Baatezu approached the village using all manner of stealth. Some had the hellspawn ability to become 
invisible at will, others could blend in naturally with their surroundings and still others could move with 
the silence of the best thieves. The Baatezu were nothing if not calculating, their attack was precisely laid 
out so the most powerful fighters and magic wielding foes were the first to fall in battle. 
</p><p align=left>
As the devils stormed into the heart of the elven village the call to arms came too late. Many elves throats 
were torn out before they could even begin to call for help.  Cinder's father Tantteer however was the first 
elf to draw arms on the attacking fiends. He screamed for Cinder to take his sister and the many children 
out of the village toward the Unicorn Run and from their to the trails leading out of the High Forrest 
toward Silverymoon.  The attack caused the light- headed Cinder to sober quickly. Without any argument 
he quickly gathered his sister and as many of the elven women and children and lead the retreat toward 
the unicorn's run. Looking over his shoulder as he left his village behind he saw his brave father for the 
last time ever.  He was engaged in a duel with the giant fiend Knuckmar. Tantteer even managed to land a 
handful of blows on the huge fiend before its massive two-handed sword severed the head from his 
father's shoulders. 
</p><p align=left>
Cinder did not tell Ellenestra what he had seen during their retreat for doing so would only cause her 
unnecessary grief and he needed her to be strong to help him calm the frantic elven children. 
</p><p align=left>
One hour into flight he called a halt to the frantic march. He counted how many women and children had 
made it out of the village. Twenty in all not counting himself and his sister. The normally skilled elven 
people had fled in such haste that they made no attempt to cover their tracks. Now was the time to due so.  
He figured he was perhaps five miles from the Unicorn Run and a slow but stealthy march would be 
preferred to the mass exodus he had just lived through. His sister and the other elven women had finally 
calmed most of the children so that they were no longer crying out for their mothers and fathers. But 
Cinder knew that if the fiends pursued them it would be impossible to outrun the devils. Then he realized 
it was already too late.
</p><p align=left>
Cinder could sense the approach of the first Baatezu before they dropped on the fleeing group.  Nets were 
thrown by many flying fiends.  Drawing his sword and dagger he was able to cleave the large net that was 
covering Ellenestra and himself.  Not willing to take flight and abandon his people Cinder closed on the 
closest fiends that could do any harm to his sister and the children.  But at his approach the fiends took a 
step back not in any fear of Cinder or his drawn blades but to allow Knuckmar the opportunity to land in 
the middle of the fray. Many of the lesser fiends where drooling in anticipation for the coming battle even 
though they were quite sure of the outcome. 
</p><p align=left>
Cinder closed on the giant fiend that he had watched decapitate his father.  The creature drew his head 
back and screamed a war cry that caused all manner of forest creatures to scurry in every direction away 
from the unnatural roar.  Cinder new this would probably be the last battle he would ever fight and he 
feared for what would become of his sister and these women and children if he fell in battle.
</p><p align=left>
Knuckmar advanced on Cinder with a measure of extreme confidence that unnerved him.  Cinder new 
better that to show any weakness in the face of such a foe. He pooled all his anger and fear and channeled 
it into a devastating  sword-dagger-sword combination. Landing as solid a series of blows as he had ever 
done on the startled Knuckmar. But to Cinder's horror the blows that would have cleaved the head from a 
grizzly bear merely glanced solidly off of Knuckmar's thick hide not even leaving signs of the merest 
scratch. 
</p><p align=left>
Cinder knew from what his father had told him about these types of creatures, that some manner of beast 
were unaffected by even the mightiest of blows if there was no magic in the attack. And although his 
weapons were finely crafted and elven forged they were not enchanted. 
</p><p align=left>
Impressed by the strength and skill of the attack, Knuckmar decided that it would be wiser to take out his 
opponent as quickly as possible. With a side ways swipe with the broad side of his huge sword Knuckmar 
bore in on Cinder. Cinder performed and aerial somersault over the top of the fiend's head avoiding the 
crushing blow intended for him. Realizing that his weapon was useless against so powerful a creature. 
Cinder landed behind the fiend, and in the same motion brought his short sword around driving the flat of 
his blade into the unsuspecting calves of Knuckmar, driving his legs out from underneath him and 
bringing him to the ground in a less that dignified fashion. As Knuckmar lifted himself off the ground his 
demeanor was one of mounting fury. Then some manner of reason seemed to calm the fiend and without 
any verbal command on his part the other fiends immediately seized all the children and women of the 
village, claws eager to tear the tender flesh of their victims. The children began to cry out in fear and 
confusion.
</p><p align=left>
Knuckmar bellowed with laughter, "Raise thy sword against me again young whelp and I will slay one 
child for every blow you strike!"
</p><p align=left>
Well that was it thought Cinder. To strike now would gain him nothing but the death of an innocent child. 
Cinder knew it would only be a matter of time before he joined his father Tantteer in death.  But he feared 
not for his own life but for that of his sister and the young women and children they now had as hostages. 
</p><p align=left>
"Stop! Please!" protested Cinder. Slowly lowering his sword and dagger toward the ground. "Do what you 
will with me but let the women and children go they have done nothing to deserve your anger." He cried. 
</p><p align=left>
And that was the last time he ever laid eyes on his world Toril again.  For as he pleaded for the release of 
his sister and the other hostages he was driven unconscious by a blow to the back of his head laying him 
low. And when he awoke he truly thought he had died and gone to hell. For the nine hells was were he 
truly awoke only he was not yet dead.

<p align=left>
Driven from his recollections of the past by Frizar's mental wining, Cinder continued down through the 
open market on his way to a particular alley three lanes past the last of the food carts.  This particular lane 
was officially called "Tarra's Way" but most cutters in the know referred to it as "Baator's Bridge."
</p><p align=left>
"It be good to see master Furcas again. We have gone long away from home." The imp mentally relayed 
to Cinder. 
</p><p align=left>
Cinder had quit trying to shield his thoughts from Frizar years earlier. But its still brought a smile to 
Cinder's face when the always excited imp tried to relay his words to him. The imp was devilishly clever 
put he seemed to lack certain aspects of grammar, and this even came through when communicating 
mentally to Cinder.  
</p><p align=left>
The little imp was bonded to Cinder when he had first come into the direct service of Furcas those five 
years ago. Much in the same way that a familiar is bonded to a wizard. Cinder knew that even though he 
could communicate telepathically. See through his eyes, and shared in its regeneration abilities, the little 
imps true purpose was to keep him in line. To serve as a constant reminder that to betray Furcas or even 
the baatezu in general would cost him his own life.  And worse, it would result in a fate worse than death 
for his enslaved sister.
</p><p align=left>
Looking through the eyes of Frizar, Cinder could make out the slight glow of the gate leading to Baator. 
He chucked slightly, thinking how ironic it was that the key to this particular gate was the stinger from a 
imp.  Well I guess the little pest has his uses after all he thought, knowing full well that Frizar was fully 
aware of his little joke. 
</p><p align=left>
"You no think loyal one Frizar would ever betray most important Master Cinder do you?" the imp asked.
</p><p align=left>
"Owe, how could I ever doubt your loyalty Frizar." Cinder replied sarcastically. "Shut your bone box now! 
If I lose any time with my sister because of your endless wining you are going to wish your master was a 
tanar'ri!"
</p><p align=left>
"Arrow stuck in Frizar's heart, you make good fiend lord master Cinder" the little imp replied.
</p><p align=left>
Cinder walked right up to the gate to hell stepping through as he had done countless times before leaving 
the Cage that is Sigil behind him.

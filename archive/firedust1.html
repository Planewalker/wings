1. THREE BLAZING FIRES
</font></p>
<p align=left>
Mid-Afternoon; Rotunda of the City Courts Building, in Sigil, the City of Doors:
</p><p align=left>"Ah," said the centaur, looking over my shoulder "I see that
you're painting."
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I replied from behind my easel.
</p><p align=left>"The hustle and bustle of what this city calls justice," the
centaur continued.  "Prisoners hobbling by in chains.  Litigants
glaring at each other as they await trial.  Judges in ermine
passing sentence on ragged beggars.  Certainly, this is fertile
ground for an artist with an eye for irony...or tragedy...or
simply the paradoxes of life.  What is your theme, young man?"
</p><p align=left>"My theme?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"What artistic statement are you making?  How the law
oppresses the powerless?  Or perhaps, if you are an optimist, how
the law, despite its flaws, is a majestic abstraction that
reflects the best within us.  Is that your statement?"
</p><p align=left>"My statement is I wish there weren't so many curlicues carved
over the entranceway.  My hand is falling asleep trying to copy
them all."
</p><p align=left>The centaur stared at me wordlessly.
</p><p align=left>"This painting," I explained, "was commissioned by Guvner
Hashkar, Chief Justice of the Courts and Factol for the
Fraternity of Order.  He said to me, Cavendish, dear fellow, the
wife's got a cousin getting married next week.  He's a right berk
of a boy, but family is family, don't you know.  Need to give a
present and the wife says a painting would be just the thing.
Just the thing, yes.  Three feet by five should do admirably, and
go easy on the reds, there's a good chap--the boy tends to faint
if he gets too excited.  Why not take a bash at a picture of the
court rotunda?  Could be inspiring.  Just the thing for the
breakfast nook.  Just the thing, yes."
</p><p align=left>"And you took this commission?"  The centaur looked aghast.
"You didn't spit in this man's face?  You didn't lecture him
about artistic integrity?"
</p><p align=left>"You don't lecture factols," I replied.  "If they ask you to
do something annoying, you simply charge more.  That's why I have
a longer list of wealthy clients than any other painter in Sigil;
I talk their language."
</p><p align=left>The centaur gaped at me for another few seconds, then stomped
away in disgust.  I have to admit, if there's one thing centaurs
are good at, it's stomping away.
</p><p align=left>Shrugging, I continued to copy the curlicues, trying to ignore
the distractions around me; and let me tell you, the City Courts
are full of distractions.  For example, lined up in front of a
door beside me stood a cornugon--one of those reptilian horrors
from the Lower Planes, nine feet tall, insect wings, a prehensile
tail like three yards of razorvine...well, you must have seen
them around.  This one was waiting stoically, reading a scroll
that had almost no words but dozens of bright orange ink drawings
of humans and demihumans being grilled over pillars of flame.  To
a cornugon, such a scroll might be anything from a bedtime story
to a menu-planner.
</p><p align=left>In line behind the hell-monster, waiting just as patiently,
was a deva from the Upper Planes: a handsome amber-skinned man,
two feet taller than me and equipped with wings as big as the
cornugon's.  The deva's wings, however, were made from feathers
of the purest gold.  A single one of the feathers could have
bought someone a nice night on the town...but as soon as my
thoughts drifted to leaving work for the day, I botched one of
the curlicues and had to dab away the error with turpentine.
</p><p align=left>Unlike the cornugon, the deva hadn't brought anything to read,
but that didn't leave him bored.  He simply fixed his eyes on the
sky outside the door of the rotunda, and soon his face settled
into an expression of rapturous contemplation of the
heavens...which, if you ask me, was a waste of good rapture,
since Sigil is shaped like a ring a few miles in diameter, and
the only thing you can see in the sky above the court building
are the grimy slums of the Hive district.  Still, gazing up on
those filthy streets didn't bother the deva; and he even managed
to maintain his serene expression when the cornugon in front
shifted its weight and flicked its scaly wings across the deva's
nose.
</p><p align=left>For a brief moment, something inside me wanted to toss away my
bland painting of the architecture and instead, work on capturing
this little moment: creatures of heaven and hell, standing side
by side and ignoring each other...or perhaps only pretending to.
This little scene said something.  I wasn't sure what it said,
but you can't show an angelic being and a demonic one in the same
picture without it being some kind of comment, right?
</p><p align=left>On the other hand...I hadn't been commissioned to paint a deva
and a cornugon.  If I suddenly decided to paint something that
interested me, who knew where it would all end?  Muttering
something about gold handcuffs, I went back to work.
</p><p align=left>"Painting a picture, huh?" said a nasal voice by my elbow.
"Do you really have to draw all those curlicues?  Couldn't you
kind of suggest them?"
</p><p align=left>I turned to see a gangly boy in his late teens squatting and
squinting at my canvas.  His skin was caramel brown, but his hair
yellow blonde, hanging haphazardly around distinctly pointed
ears.  One of his parents must have been human, the other an elf;
and neither side of the family could take much pride in the
result.  "Do I know you?" I asked, trying to sound forbidding.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah Virtue," he replied, holding out a hand that was
overly blessed with knuckles.  Looking down at my paintbox, he
read my name printed there.  "Britlin Cavendish...well it's an
honor to meet you."
</p><p align=left>"You've heard of me?"
</p><p align=left>"Nope.  But it's an honor to meet anyone in Sigil; I've only
been here two days.  Do you belong to a faction?"
</p><p align=left>I sighed.  My jacket clearly displayed the "five senses"
symbol of the Society of Sensation, and the symbol was repeated
on my signet ring and the top of my paintbox.  However, that
obviously didn't mean anything to this Clueless child.  "I have
the privilege of being a Sensate," I told him.  "Our society is
dedicated to savoring all the abundance the multiverse can
offer."
</p><p align=left>"Oh, my Uncle Toby told me about you guys," he answered, his
eyes growing wide.  "You must have a lot of wild parties, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Wrong.  One wild party in a lifetime usually exhausts that
field of experience.  Then we move on to more refined pursuits."
</p><p align=left>"Oh."  Clearly, the boy had no idea what a refined pursuit
might be.  Then his face brightened, and he reached into a cloth
bag he carried in one hand.  "Have you ever tried swineberries?"
</p><p align=left>The name made me wrinkle my nose.  "Swineberries?"
</p><p align=left>He pulled out a handful of greasy brown berries, each about
the size of my thumb.  They were flat and wrinkled, as if someone
had stepped on them with spike-heeled boots.  "I brought them
with me from home," the boy said.  "My home plane.  I'm not from
around here.  The berries aren't as fresh as they used to be, but
they're still pretty good."  He popped one in his mouth and
chewed vigorously.  "You should try one."
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I admitted, "I should."  A Sensate never says no to a
new experience, even if it turns out to be some boring new prune
from the Prime Material Plane.  I told myself if the taste proved
to be as lackluster as I expected-- swineberries!--at least I'd
have something to joke about the next time I had dinner with my
fellow Sensates.
</p><p align=left>Of course, I couldn't just pop the berry in my mouth and chew,
like the boy did.  You don't rush such things.  You have to hold
the berry lightly in your fingertips, testing the weight and
texture in the fruit.  Then you lift it to your nose and smell
its bouquet--a light, sugary fragrance, with a teasing hint of
musk.  Then, and only then, do you slip it between your teeth and
bite down gently...whereupon, you discover the sodding berry
tastes like pure rock salt.
</p><p align=left>I'd eaten pure rock salt before--it was part of the Sensate
initiation ceremony.  As any Sensate can tell you, once is
enough.
</p><p align=left>Reluctantly, I swallowed.
</p><p align=left>"What did you think of the berry?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"I hated it."
</p><p align=left>"Oh.  But I guess that's all right, isn't it?  Because Uncle
Toby says Sensates want to experience everything, good and bad."
</p><p align=left>"Your Uncle Toby is a font of information," I replied through
clenched teeth.
</p><p align=left>"Hey," the boy said, "do you think these berries would go over
big with the Sensates?  Because I'd like to talk to one of your
high-up men, to see what I have to do to join your group."
</p><p align=left>I nearly choked.  "You want to join the Sensates?"
</p><p align=left>"Uncle Toby says I should join some faction.  A man has to
have friends in the Cage, that's what Uncle Toby says.  He calls
Sigil the Cage, I don't know why.  So I'm going around, talking
to all the factions, to find out more about them.  That's why I'm
here in the courts, to talk to a Guvner.  I love how Sigil people
say Guvner, instead of Governor the way they'd say it back home.
I love how people talk here: Stop rattling your bone-box, you
Clueless berk, or I'll do you a slice-job.  I hear that all the
time.  By the way, what's a slice-job?"
</p><p align=left>"You're going to find out any minute," I muttered.
</p><p align=left>"On the other hand," Hezekiah continued unstoppably, "I
haven't heard you use any quaint local expressions yet.  Are you
from out of town too?"
</p><p align=left>I looked down at the fine-tipped paintbrush in my hand and
idly wondered if it would be ruined by plunging it into the boy's
eye.  Control, Britlin, control.  My mother was the daughter of a
duke and cozzled me all through childhood not to talk like the
leatherheads in the street--to sound cultured and refined so that
city aristocrats would admit me to their drawing rooms.  She had
never been heavy-handed about it ("Yes Britlin, little Oswald
next door is a berk; now how would we say that in real words?")
but it was a matter of family loyalty for me to stay true to her
ideals, and I did not need some Prime-world pippin insulting me
on that score.  I racked my brains, trying to produce some
scathing remark that would send this Clueless boy packing; but
before I could think of a devastating response, I noticed a trio
of Harmonium guards enter in lock-step through the front doors of
the rotunda.
</p><p align=left>Of course, there's nothing unusual about Harmonium members in
the courts building--as Sigil's police force, their duties often
bring them to the halls of justice.  However, this particular
group stood out for several disturbing reasons.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>First, all three had made a mess of folding their gray
neckerchiefs.  Harmonium officers are fastidious about their
neckerchiefs--when I painted the portrait of Harmonium Factol
Sarin, he demanded that I reproduce every little tuck and fold
precisely.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Second, the three men in front of me didn't walk like
Harmonium guards.  Guards spend most of their time patrolling a
beat through the city; even raw recruits soon acquire a measured
gait that lets them walk all day while keeping alert to possible
mischief.  The men entering the rotunda had a more military edge
to their pace--they didn't stroll, they marched.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Finally, my keen Sensate's eye picked up one more out-of-place
detail.  In addition to swords, normal Harmonium guards always
carry stout black truncheons, reserved for those rare occasions
when their commander is struck by the whim to take a wrongdoer
alive.  The three men in front of me, however, had quite
different weapons hanging from their belts; sleek white batons
carved from ivory or bone, their surfaces speckled with a red
glitter that might be chips of ruby.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"What are you looking at?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I was just thinking, maybe I'll pack up now and take another
crack at those curlicues tomorrow."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Are you trying to avoid those guards?" the boy whispered, as
he noticed me eyeing the newcomers.  "Maybe you have some dark
secret in your past, and those guys are a special elite team who
might recognize you from former days?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Why do you think those guards are elite?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Because they're the first I've seen carrying firewands
instead of truncheons."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Those are firewands?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The boy shrugged.  "Uncle Toby taught me all about wands and
stuff."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I groaned.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>A rational man might have taken to his heels that very
second--three impostor guards walking into the Courts with high-
powered magical weapons meant big, big trouble.  On the other
hand, I had never seen a firewand in action; and if I could find
a safe place to hide before anyone started shooting, I might
witness something well worth remembering.  If this turned into a
major incident, maybe I could even paint the scene afterward.
Those piking art critics couldn't accuse me of sterility if I
made a perfect reproduction of some horrible disaster.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Unfortunately, my first glance around the rotunda didn't
reveal any good places to dive for cover.  Factol Hashkar may
have hired me to do a painting, but his most beloved artform was
tapestry; as soon as he became leader of the Guvners, he had
covered every inch of City Court wallspace with dusty old banners
depicting the many planes of the multiverse.  Those acres of
cloth would blaze like tinder if the wands started blasting
fireballs...and that could happen any minute.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The three guards reached the center of the rotunda floor, and
turned inward to face each other in a huddle.  They wanted us to
believe they were discussing private guard business; but I knew
they were concealing their motions as they pulled the wands from
their belts.  Would they simply start shooting?  Or was this a
more complicated plan, "Lie down and give us your money!" or a
scheme to grab hostages in protest of the latest tax hike?  It
didn't matter.  I was at the rear of the hall, too far from the
door to get outside before the pyrotechnics began, so I had to
take the only cover available.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Come on, Hezekiah," I commanded, grabbing him by the scruff
of the neck.  Then, crossing my fingers that this would work, I
jammed the two of us directly behind the cornugon.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"What are you playing at, berk?" growled the monster, as it
whipped around to look at us.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Sorry," I said, "but you're from the Nine Hells.  You're
flameproof."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Which was the precise moment when the first fireball struck
the cornugon's back.
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Even with the cornugon taking the brunt of the blast, huge
tongues of flame splashed over me for a second, buffeting my face
with broiling air.  A few paces away, my paints and canvas
blossomed with fire, followed a moment later by the turpentine
can exploding into a fierce yellow blaze.  Smoke was everywhere,
people screamed throughout the great hall, and who knew how many
other throats were too scorched to make more than a croak?
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>In front of us, the cornugon hadn't suffered a single blister;
after all, the creature came from a plane noted for its flaming
infernos, so a paltry fireball was no more annoying than a
mosquito bite.  Still, the fireblast was an attack, and a
completely unexpected one, since the cornugon had been glaring at
Hezekiah and me when the false guards let fly.  Angrily, the
reptile-fiend raised a sharp-taloned hand as if it intended to
claw off a strip of my flesh...but then second thoughts flashed
through its beady black eyes and it swung around to slash the
deva instead.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I have no idea if the cornugon actually believed the deva was
responsible for the attack, or if the monster simply seized the
excuse to swipe at a species he hated.  Either way, the
cornugon's claws ripped two handfuls of feathers from the deva's
wings, and a moment later, the monster's hellishly barbed tail
lashed the deva across the chest like a whip.  Beads of shining
gold blood trickled out where the thorny tail broke the deva's
skin.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Until that moment, the deva had scarcely budged from his
serene contemplation of the sky.  Certainly, the fireball had
singed off some wingfeathers, since a life of celestial bliss
doesn't flameproof you like crawling through the bowels of hell;
but the deva didn't react until the cornugon's attack had drawn
blood.  Then, with the speed of a whizzing arrow, the deva
flashed out his fists, one, two-- a jab to the cornugon's snout,
and a beautiful palm-heel strike to its scale-covered gut.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The cornugon wheezed once and buckled to its knees.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Wow," said Hezekiah.  "I always thought angels fought with
magic swords."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"First," I replied, "he's not an angel, he's a deva.  Second,
devas don't fight with swords, they use maces.  Third, he's not
going to whack a cornugon with his mace in the middle of Sigil
unless he wants an all-out war that will get both sides ejected
from the city.  Finally, in case you haven't noticed, the one
thing that was shielding us from the flames is now sprawled
gasping on the ground."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Indeed, we were completely exposed to the rest of the rotunda,
and a hideous sight it was.  The three false guards must have
stood back-to-back and loosed their fireballs simultaneously,
launching bright orange flames in all directions.  I could
immediately identify the three points of impact from the bursts:
those three areas were littered with dead bodies, the corpses'
flesh roasted and split into hard red cracks.  Farther out, some
people had survived the initial flash...or maybe they were just
taking longer to die.  Their skin was puckered and oozing out
fluid, their eye sockets empty pits running with melted jelly.  A
few made shrill whistling cries, the only kind of scream possible
through a throat ravaged by fire.  Most simply lay silent,
squeezing themselves into balls of agony and shuddering with
misery.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The explosions had focused on the three interior walls of the
rotunda.  The fourth side of the room, the arch opening into the
street, was still untouched, and people who remained on their
feet had begun to mob the exit, crushing together in a panic.
Shorter beings, gnomes and halflings, would surely be trampled in
the stampede down the front steps...not to mention children and
the elderly.  After the first casualties fell, some of those
jamming in behind would trip over the broken bodies, and they too
would be battered by the feet of the crowd.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>At the center of the rotunda, impassive in the heart of chaos,
stood the three false guards--even the most fear-crazed members
of the mob gave the guards a wide berth.  The impostor facing our
direction was a heavily-bearded man with bleached white hair, his
eye carefully watching the deva; and when the deva turned away
from the cornugon to confront the creators of this destruction,
the false guard calmly lifted his wand to shoot again.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The cornugon was on its hands and knees, providing no cover at
all.  Any fireball aimed at the deva would easily catch Hezekiah
and me in the blast radius.  I had time to scream, "No!"...
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>...and then I was standing in a paper-stacked office, facing a
young halfling woman in judicial robes.  She looked as surprised
to see me as I was to see her.  "Who are you?" she snapped.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Before I could answer, Hezekiah stepped forward from my side.
"Hezekiah Virtue," he said, holding out his knuckly hand for her
to shake.  "Sorry to pop in on you, ma'am, but we were in a nasty
situation and I had to teleport us out of there."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I stared at him in disbelief.  "You can teleport?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Sure," he answered.  "Learned it from Uncle Toby."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Of course you did," I sighed.
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>As soon as we began to explain about the fire attack, the
halfling hurried us down the hall to the office of Her Honor,
Judge Emeritus Oonah DeVail.  I had never met DeVail personally,
but all of Sigil knew her by reputation--an old bone-rattler, a
basher, a woman of action.  Unlike the majority of Guvners who
prefer the academic approach to knowledge, Oonah DeVail had spent
much of her life exploring the planes in person, leading
expedition after expedition into the far corners of the
multiverse and bringing back a wealth of arcane curiosities.  It
didn't surprise me that the halfling went running to DeVail when
looking for someone to cope with an emergency situation.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Firewands?" DeVail roared.  "In the rotunda?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Yes, Your Honor," I said.  "Three men just walked in..."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>That was as far as I got.  DeVail was a woman in her sixties,
but with darting speed, she snatched up a staff bound with
gleaming silver wire and used its support to hike herself to her
feet.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah scampered to open the door for her.  "It'd be a
mighty big honor to help you to safety, ma'am," he said.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Help yourself to safety," she snapped.  With one hand, she
swept her staff off the floor and swung it high over her head.
An arc of sparkling ice crystals spattered out of its swinging
tip.  "No flamethrowing berks will give our courts the laugh
while I'm around."  With that, she dashed out the door, suddenly
as spry as a twelve-year-old.  The halfling woman waved at us to
stay where we were, then hurried along behind DeVail to a wide-
open waiting area some dozen paces down the corridor.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Pausing just a second for the halfling to catch up, DeVail
slammed the butt of her staff onto the floor with an echoing
whump.  Beneath her feet, carpet and floorboards faded to an inky
blackness, like a hole filled with deepest midnight.  The
halfling woman looked at the hole, looked at DeVail, then leaped,
grabbing Her Honor around the waist.  Together the two of them
sank into that hole: the halfling wearing a grim expression,
DeVail's lips moving in some kind of silent incantation.  The
moment their heads disappeared into the hole, the blackness
sealed itself shut again with a muffled rumble.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah let the door close slowly, his face filled with
wonderment.  The feeling was mutual--I had no idea what else
DeVail's staff could do, but the short ivory firewands used by
the false guards now seemed a lot less formidable.  The Sensate
in me sighed with regret that I'd miss the coming battle in the
rotunda.  Then I remembered the charred skin of the dead, the
horrid moans of the living...and I decided there were some things
even a Sensate didn't need to see.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Shall we try to find a way out?" I said to Hezekiah.  "We may
be safe from the fire for the moment, but if the whole building
starts to burn..."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"In a minute," he replied.  "I want a chance to look at this
great stuff."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>And indeed, Guvner DeVail's office was cluttered to the
rafters with "great stuff": delicately painted porcelain,
brassbound chests, mummified animals hanging from ropes attached
to the ceiling...dozens upon dozens of outlandish curios, and
most no doubt reeking of magic.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Don't touch anything!" I snapped at Hezekiah, who was about
to pick up a copper-framed handmirror.  "For that matter, don't
even look at anything!  If you stare into that mirror, you have
no idea what might stare back."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I wasn't hurting anything," he answered defensively.  He
closed his eyes, furrowed his brow for a moment, then opened his
eyes again to look at the mirror in his hand.  "It doesn't matter
anyway," he said.  "The mirror's okay.  It's not magic."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"How do you know?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"If I concentrate, I can sense a kind of radiation coming off
magical things.  Uncle Toby taught me that whenever I'm in a
strange place, I should--"  Hezekiah stopped abruptly and snapped
his head around toward the door.  In a low whisper, he said,
"Something with a lot of magic is coming straight at us."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Probably Judge DeVail and that staff of hers."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>He shook his head.  "I don't think so."  Once more his brow
furrowed in concentration, then he whispered, "Hide!"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Much as I hated taking orders from a Clueless, the worry on
Hezekiah's face suggested this was not the time for argument.
Beside me stood a coat-tree with several bulky cloaks hanging
from its hooks; I nipped behind it and quickly fanned out the
cloaks so they'd conceal me without looking too unnatural.  Given
a little luck, none of the cloaks would turn me into a frog.
Given a lot of luck, maybe one of the cloaks would make me
invisible.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I left a tiny gap in the arrangement of clothing, just enough
to let me peek out with one eye.  Hezekiah was nowhere to be
seen, but I could hear him shuffling around outside my line of
sight, no doubt burrowing into the jumble of souvenirs Guvner
DeVail kept from her trips across the planes.  After a few
seconds, his scurrying stopped...and a good thing too, because
half a second later, the door eased open with a creak.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Two shadowed figures stood in the entranceway, both carrying
cocked crossbows.  They relaxed slowly as they scanned the room.
"I told you," whispered one of them, "I saw the old basher light
out with some halfling.  Right through the floor, she went."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The other only grunted.  "Where do you think she keeps it?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Try the desk first."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The one who just spoke stepped farther into the room, crossbow
still at the ready.  In the light from the oil lamp on the
Guvner's desk, the intruder was tall and thin, with raggedly
pointed ears and cat-like yellow eyes--a githzerai, and one that
looked fiercer than usual, if that was possible.  Sigil has a
sizable population of githzerai, but I didn't know any
personally.  Their race prides itself on severity, and never
spends its gold on indulgences like art; therefore, githzerai and
I don't move in the same circles.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>As the githzerai moved toward DeVail's desk, the other
intruder entered the spill of light from the lamp.  I gulped hard
to stop myself from gasping.  This one had a face much like his
githzerai companion, but his skin was as yellow as corn and his
eyes like black marbles.  Unless I was hallucinating, this was a
githyanki: closely related to the githzerai race, but its bitter
blood enemy.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>A githzerai and githyanki working together?  That was like a
fire sprite inviting a water elemental to dance the minuet.  The
two gith races hated each other with the purest of passions,
killing one another on sight whenever they happened to meet.  The
only time the githzerai and githyanki had ever agreed on anything
was when they declared genocidal war on each other.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>This had to be an illusion--a shapeshifting disguise.  For all
I knew these two might be gnome sorcerer-thieves, wearing an
enchantment so they couldn't be identified as they looted this
office.  At least that made sense.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The two laid their crossbows on the Guvner's desk and began
rummaging through the drawers.  From my angle I could only see
the githzerai, and his body blocked my view of most of the desk.
Still, I caught the occasional glimpse of him lifting up one
scroll after another, unrolling a length to skim the contents,
then discarding the parchment into a growing pile on the floor.
The nonchalance of his actions made me wince--not just because of
his disdain for scrolls that might carry priceless ancient
knowledge, but at his lack of concern for magical consequences.
Some scrolls don't allow themselves to be read and tossed away.
They can have curses or booby-traps, even imprisoned monsters who
leap forth to shred unwary pilferers.  Under normal
circumstances, I wouldn't care if two thieves got themselves
eaten; but I didn't want to be nabbed for dessert.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Finally, the githyanki said, "This looks like it."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The githzerai dropped the scroll he was holding.  "Dust?" he
asked.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Yeah.  She's even drawn a map."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"How convenient.  Let's go."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The githyanki refolded the scroll he had found and tucked it
inside his vest.  Meanwhile, the githzerai picked up the oil lamp
from DeVail's desk and held it above the mound of scrolls they
had thrown on the floor.  "By the time the old basher returns,"
he said, "this place'll be burning as bright as downstairs.
They'll think it's all part of the same blaze."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Maybe," his partner replied.  "But Her Nibs told me to torch
a few more offices so the Guvs aren't suspicious about this one.
I've got a list of rooms that're empty."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The githzerai sniffed the air.  "Once people smell smoke,
they'll empty the whole building."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>He picked up his crossbow and headed for the exit.  In his
hand, he still carried the lighted oil lamp.  At the door, he
waited while his partner peered out to check that the hall was
clear.  After a moment, the githyanki nodded.  "Let's go."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The one with the lamp turned around in the doorway for one
last look at the room.  Then, curling his lip with disdain, he
threw the lamp onto the stack of scrolls and slammed the door
behind him.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Both Hezekiah and I dove instantly from our hiding places to
snuff out the flames.  It was a close call--the parchments were
old and dry, and paraffin oil had splashed about liberally as the
lamp struck the floor.  Fortunately, the glass lamp cracked but
didn't break; and with the help of the cloaks from the coat-tree,
we smothered the blaze before it got out of hand.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Who were those guys?" Hezekiah panted as we eased back from
the mound of crispy-edged scrolls.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"How should I know?" I replied.  "Do you think I recognize
every thug in Sigil?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Just asking," he shrugged.  "What do we do now?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Well, we could cool our heels chatting and see if the
building burns down around us; or we could pike it out of here
before we singe off our eyebrows.  Do you have a preference?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Clueless though he was, Hezekiah opted for the sensible
choice; and soon, we were blundering our way through the
corridors of the court building, trying to find a way out.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>This wing was taken up with private offices for high-level
Guvners, all of whom appeared to be elsewhere.  While I had
visited the public areas of the courts a few times, I had never
come to this part of the building; and Hezekiah was no help in
figuring out where we were, because he admitted he had teleported
out of the rotunda, completely blind.  It was sheer luck we
hadn't materialized inside a solid wall.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>In time, we rounded a corner and saw a doorway down the hall,
pouring out roils of black smoke.  We approached cautiously,
worried about bumping into our arsonist thieves, but reluctant to
turn tail if someone inside needed our help.  The door opened
into a large room filled with row upon row of bookracks; and one
shelf of the rack closest to us had been pierced by a flaming
crossbow bolt.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Our friends from the office have been here," I muttered,
pointing at the arrow.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"They're setting fire to a library?" Hezekiah cried in
outrage.  "That's criminal!"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Despite the smoke, he charged forward, shouting, "We can still
save most of the books!"  Never mind that the rack where the
fire-arrow had landed was almost completely ablaze.  Never mind
the stupidity of running into a room full of paper just before
flames make it impossible to get back out the door.  Hezekiah ran
straight into the library like some duty-brained knight.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"What do you think you're doing?" I yelled at him.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Only one set of shelves are burning," he called, stepping
into the gap between the blazing rack and the one behind it.  "If
we can separate these from the rest of the books..."  His voice
broke off as he inhaled a lungful of smoke and buckled over
coughing.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Damn it, Hezekiah!"  I took a step into the room, then
stopped to ask myself what I was doing.  If a Clueless nobody
wanted to die playing hero, why should I risk my own hide to save
him?  I'd only known him for ten minutes, and they had been ten
solid minutes of annoyance and terror.  Granted, Hezekiah hadn't
been responsible for the terror part; in fact, his teleport spell
had saved my life...
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Damn it," I said again, and ran in after him, keeping low to
stay out of the smoke.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>When I reached his side, he had struggled to his feet and was
pushing weakly against the blazing bookrack.  "Shove this rack
forward against the wall," he choked out, "then we shove the
other racks back as far away as we can, so they don't catch
fire."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"You're barmy!" I told him.  "These shelves are loaded with
books.  They must weigh tons."  I hiked my hands under his
armpits to steady him on his feet--the lungful of smoke had hit
him hard.  "The only thing we can do," I said, "is run."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"No, we can save the books."  He squirmed away from me and
planted his palms on one shelf of the bookrack--a strip of wood
that had yet to catch fire.  "I'm not going till we save the
books."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>He shoved the rack feebly, with no discernible effect.  "Come
on," he gasped at me.  "Help!"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Sure," I replied.  "Help.  Well, I've never set myself on
fire before.  The other Sensates will be green with envy."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I could have chosen finesse.  I could have chosen to treat the
books with delicate reverence.  But there was smoke everywhere,
the rack and half its books were on fire, and I was past the
point of subtlety.  Our goal was to separate the blazing rack
from the others.  Trusting my boots to protect me for a few
seconds, I stepped up onto a shelf of the rack that was on fire,
planted my hands against the adjacent rack, and thrust with all
my strength.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The burning rack yielded first, tipping away under my heels to
slam against the front wall of the room.  A moment later, the
other rack tipped backwards, boom into the rack behind it.  That
rack tipped too, and a third, and a fourth, boom, boom, boom,
like dominoes, a ripple of one crash after another as the whole
library toppled gracefully backward.  The motion didn't even stop
at the rear wall--when the final rack struck the plaster it kept
on going, smashing a hole through the wall as big as a haycart.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"We did it!" shouted Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"You piking well did it, all right," said a new voice.  I
looked up to see a burly Harmonium guard towering above me.  He
had his truncheon drawn and seemed aching to use it.  "You two
berks are under arrest," he bellowed, grabbing me by the arm and
hauling me to my feet.  "And I truly hope you resist, because I'm
in the mood to break some skulls.  Got me?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Oh good," Hezekiah piped up.  "I wanted to meet someone in
the Harmonium so I could ask about your membership requirements."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I buried my face in my hands.

2. THREE CONCERNED FACTOLS
</font></p>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>If you walk (or are dragged) into the main Harmonium guard
barracks, the first thing you'll see is a ten-foot tall portrait
of their leader, Factol Sarin...and wasn't I glad that I'd gotten
on his good side by copying the folds on his neckerchief exactly.
Of course, the Harmonium were such a bunch of hardcases, they
wouldn't let me go just because I'd painted Factol Sarin from his
best profile; but at least when they learned who I was, they
stopped swinging their truncheons so recklessly near my skull.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Half a battalion of guards escorted Hezekiah and me to
separate interrogation rooms, and that was the last I saw of the
boy for many hours.  A sharp-eyed sergeant took my statement,
seldom letting me say more than a sentence before interrupting
with nitpicky questions.  Of course, I told the exact truth,
holding nothing back--I had no reason to hide anything I'd seen
or done.  I dearly hoped Hezekiah was doing the same in his
interrogation...not that he was likely to lie, but the idiotic
Clueless might skip over important details in his hurry to start
quizzing the guards about Harmonium philosophy.  If he annoyed
them too much, they might bash out his brains before he had a
chance to corroborate my story.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Even though the interrogation room had thick marble walls,
they weren't thick enough to block out all the noise in the
barracks that evening.  Every minute or so, footsteps would race
past the door outside; and several times an hour, I heard distant
yelling, not clear enough for me to make out words, but with the
tone of someone bellowing orders to subordinates.  The sergeant
interrogating me refused to share any news about how things had
turned out at the courts, but judging by the barracks clamor, I
guessed the attackers had escaped.  Now the guards were scouring
the city in search of the killers.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>After several hours, the sergeant exhausted his questions and
left me locked in the room with a couple of watchful-eyed
corporals.  Clearly, the sergeant was not happy with my story--"A
githyanki and githzerai working together...how addle-coved do you
think I am?"--but he knew the time had come to find his commander
and discuss what to do next.  It wasn't every day that Sigil
suffered a massacre in the Courts, and the investigation would
surely fall under scrutiny from high places.  The sergeant and
everyone else in the Harmonium would move with the utmost caution
to avoid legal slip-ups.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Another hour passed...or at least what felt like an hour,
cooped up with two Harmonium guards who were built like mountains
and just about as talkative.  They stood on either side of the
door, arms folded across their chests and eyes glued on me,
instantly ready to gut me with their swords if it looked like I
intended to cast some nefarious spell.  "I don't know any
spells," I snapped at them around the half-hour mark, when their
rigid gazes had begun to get on my nerves.  Of course, that only
made them more suspicious.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>At long last, the door opened again; but instead of the
sergeant, the newcomers were Factol Sarin of the Harmonium,
Factol Hashkar of the Guvners, and Factol Erin Darkflame
Montgomery of my own Society of Sensation.  Even though I knew
all three personally, I bowed promptly and respectfully to
each--three factols traveling in company are not just plain
folks, but an official delegation.  Still, Lady Erin made a show
of greeting me, as one Sensate to another.  "Britlin!" she said,
taking my hand firmly in hers.  "It seems you've been havin' an
adventure."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Indeed, my lady."  I had, of course, met her several times at
Sensate functions, even sitting at her table once during the
Feast of the Wind's Blush.  Feast tradition demanded a large
table, and my chair had been fourteen places away from hers,
sandwiched between a minor baroness from the Outlands and a
representative from the Fraternal Order of Ironmongers.
Nevertheless, Lady Erin had come around the table to speak with
me in her soft Outlands accent, discussing watercolors for
several delightful minutes; then, she moved to an equally warm
conversation with the fellow on my right, this time about
threepenny nails.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The odd thing was, she really did care about watercolors,
nails, and all the other topics she discussed at the table that
night.  Our factol was not just a strikingly beautiful woman on
the outside (so splendid I had promised her a ten percent
discount if she ever wanted a portrait, just for the delight of
having her pose in my studio); but she was also a paragon of
loveliness inwardly, in compassion, intelligence, and sheer
personal vibrancy.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The congenial way she greeted me in the interrogation room
suggested she believed I had acquitted myself well during the
mayhem at the City Courts.  That counted for a lot; although she
was only in her thirties, Lady Erin headed the largest voting
bloc in Sigil's Hall of Speakers--many other cities would grant
her the title of Mayor.  If she vouched for me, I had little to
fear in the short term.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Besides, Guvner Hashkar and Captain Sarin both wore benign
expressions as well...somber, yes, and tense with the strain of
handling what must be a difficult night on the streets, but with
no animosity toward me.  Indeed, Guvner Hashkar came forward to
shake my hand, saying, "Hear you saved a library, dear boy.  Most
of it, anyway.  Good work, excellent work.  Well worth a medal or
citation, something like that.  Our chief of protocol will decide
what's appropriate, once she calms down.  Might be a few weeks.
She's the one who has to put the books back on those racks.
Still, she's grateful, very grateful.  We all are."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I bowed once more--quite a low bow, since Hashkar was an
elderly dwarf: only four foot two to begin with, and now stooped
with age.  The biggest thing about him was his extravagant white
moustaches, dangling like string mops nearly all the way to the
floor.  Some claimed he grew them to draw attention away from the
aggressively red bulbousness of his nose.  On the other hand,
maybe he liked those moustaches because they made him look
doddering and senile; in debates at the Hall of Speakers, Hashkar
liked being dismissed as a dithering old fool until he suddenly
swooped in for the kill, destroying his opponents' arguments with
a single casual remark.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Enough gab," said Captain Sarin, briskly.  From what I'd
seen, Sarin did everything briskly--rather alarming when he came
to my studio to pose for his portrait, because the way he
barreled around, I was sure he'd step in a pot of paint.  He
didn't.  Sarin might be equipped with shoulders as wide as a
buffalo and muscles to match, but it wasn't strength alone that
won him leadership of the Harmonium.  "Now," he went on, "we have
a few questions to ask you, Mister Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Of course, sir."  I bowed once more, because that's what you
do when a factol calls you "mister".
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"In the statement you gave to my sergeant, you simply stated
the facts.  Now we'd like your opinions.  Hunches, suspicions,
impressions...you're a blood with a keen eye and your work gives
you contact with plenty of folks here in the Cage.  What do you
make of this all?  If you had to guess, would you say the
attackers were Anarchists?  Or maybe Chaosmen?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Neither, sir."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Captain Sarin raised an eyebrow.  I hurried to explain.  "The
Anarchists have a lot of experience pretending to be Harmonium
guards--disguise is part of their basic training.  I'd guess
there are half a dozen Anarchists in this building right now,
eavesdropping on the way you're handling the present situation."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The captain made a face.  "You're probably right."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"So," I said, "they aren't going to make an elementary mistake
like folding their neckerchiefs wrong.  Anarchists are just too
good at infiltration to slip up like that.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"As for the Chaosmen," I continued, "they don't have the
discipline for what I saw.  The false guards marched like
soldiers and fired in unison--Chaosmen simply wouldn't allow
themselves to be regimented like that.  They might dash wildly
into the building, fire about at random, then run away again; but
they'd despise the very idea of planning the attack with military
precision, and they certainly wouldn't carry it off."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The captain cast a glance at Guvner Hashkar and Lady Erin.
They both nodded.  Sarin sighed.  "That's pretty much what we
concluded too," he told me.  "We hoped you might have noticed
something to indicate otherwise.  Life would be less complicated
if we could blame this mess on the usual pus-kickers."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I take it you didn't capture any of the attackers?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"All three escaped," Lady Erin answered with a keen edge of
anger.  "As you say, the massacre was planned with military
precision.  The moment Judge DeVail showed up with that staff of
hers, one of the fireballin' berks shouted, 'Hop it!' and
activated some magical boojum.  They disappeared in a shimmer of
light, and no one knows where.  DeVail fired into the shimmer
anyway on the off chance they'd just turned invisible; but it
didn't do any good."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Does Judge DeVail know what the thieves stole from her
office?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Haven't been able to talk to her yet," Guvner Hashkar
replied.  "Soon as the attackers vanished, Oonah started helping
the poor sods who got caught in the middle.  Tried to calm the
mob, bandage the injured...even stopped the deva and cornugon who
were still brawling in the middle of the flames.  Eventually, the
old girl pushed her luck too far-- inhaled more smoke than she
could handle.  Healers got to her in time and she'll be right as
rain in the morning; but for now she's sleeping, and they don't
want us to wake her."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Pity," I said.  "If we knew what those two had stolen, maybe
we'd have a clue what was really going on."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Captain Sarin grunted.  "You're certain the theft was
connected with the fire attack?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Absolutely," I told him.  "First of all, the thieves had been
waiting in a position to see Judge DeVail dash to the rescue.
Then they went straight to her office and rummaged through her
desk for one specific scroll, ignoring dozens of valuable curios
in the rest of the room.  Once they had the scroll, they
systematically torched her office and other rooms to cover their
tracks, intending the secondary fires to be dismissed as
offshoots of the fire downstairs.  They must have known about the
fire attack ahead of time, and were poised to move on DeVail's
office once the coast was clear.  My guess is the fireballs were
simply a diversion to make it easier for the thieves to get in
and out without being noticed."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"But a githyanki and githzerai working together," Sarin shook
his head.  "That's almost impossible to believe."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Their appearance could have been an illusion, or some
temporary shapeshift.  Remember, Hezekiah knew they were coming
because they radiated magic."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Maybe," Lady Erin said, pursing her lips.  "Still, if they
had the magic to disguise themselves, why become a githyanki and
githzerai?  It'd make more sense to look like Guvners or
Harmonium guards.  That way they wouldn't stand out if someone
noticed them in the hall."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"A good point," Sarin admitted.  "But I still think--"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>There was a sharp knock on the door, and a lieutenant of the
guard hurried in without waiting to be invited.  She handed the
captain a slip of paper which he read in silence.  I could tell
that Lady Erin and Guvner Hashkar were both aching to read over
Sarin's shoulder, but they managed to restrain themselves until
the captain looked up grimly.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Bad news?" Lady Erin asked.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Not exactly news," Sarin muttered.  Glancing in my direction
he hesitated a moment, clearly debating whether to say more in
front of me.  Before I could offer to leave, however, Sarin
simply shrugged and continued.  "I asked some of the bright
bloods in our backroom to propose theories about what in The
Lady's name is happening here.  They've dug up some troubling
connections."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"What connections?" Hashkar asked.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Ten days ago, there was an ugly little riot in the Gatehouse
asylum--the part of the building used as headquarters for the
Bleak Cabal.  Everyone knows a fair number of barmies in the
asylum used to be wizards, till they learned one too many secrets
mortals weren't meant to know.  Anyway, one of those wizards
escaped, got his hands on the ingredients he needed for some
fireballs, and freed a whole block of other violent inmates.  The
wizard vanished and the others demolished a good chunk of Bleaker
HQ before they could be stopped."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And what does this have to do with the courts?" Lady Erin
asked with some impatience.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Keep listening," Sarin replied.  "Six days ago, a furnace in
the Great Foundry blew out one of its walls.  Flames and molten
metal sprayed all over the place--dozens of poor sods killed,
heavy property damage, and surprise, surprise: most of the damage
was centered in the part of the foundry the Godsmen use as their
headquarters."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I read the reports on that," Lady Erin said.  "Everyone
agreed it was an accident, pure and simple."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"If you like accidents, try this on for size," Sarin told her.
"Two nights ago, we had a serious fire in the Hive...not unusual
for slums, but my bloods tell me it took out several buildings
the Xaositects used as headquarters."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lady Erin's eyes narrowed.  "So you're sayin' there've been
three disasters in three faction headquarters..."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Four disasters," Guvner Hashkar corrected.  "The City Courts
are headquarters to my faction."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And all four involved fire," the captain added.  "How's that
for coincidence?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"All right," Lady Erin said.  "I'm callin' an emergency
session in the Hall of Speakers.  One hour from now.  Every
factol of every faction, if they can make it.  Can you send out
runners, Captain?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I'll pass the word," Sarin nodded.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And are you finished with Mr. Cavendish?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The captain nodded again.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Then," she said, turning to me, "I'd appreciate you waitin'
for me at the Festhall.  It may be some time before I get back
there, but my steward'll see to your needs--food, a place to
sleep, don't hesitate to ask.  Of course, you realize none of
what you've just heard can leave this room?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Of course, my lady."  I bowed very low.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Very well then," she smiled grimly, "let's all get to work.
It's promisin' to be a long night."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The three factols hurried out immediately.  The rest of us,
lieutenant, corporals and I, all kept bowing until the door
closed behind them.  Who knows if factols really care whether
people bow to them or not?  But I, for one, didn't want to be the
first person to defy the custom to their faces.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The lieutenant waited for a good count of twenty before
opening the door to leave.  I suppose she wanted to make sure the
factols were well gone before she ventured into the hall--like
me, she must have had enough bowing for one day.  Trying not to
be obvious about it, she looked both ways to check that the
corridor was empty; then she instructed the corporals to handle
my release, and sped away to other duties.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Releasing me was simply a matter of returning my money pouch
and the other things I'd been carrying when arrested.  None of my
possessions were particularly ominous: my keys, some peanuts in a
small cloth bag, and a chip of quartz which gave off a permanent
lantern-like glow, thanks to a fellow Sensate who was now loafing
as the Witch-Queen of some scruffy Prime world.  Still, the
Harmonium had impounded everything in my pockets, just on general
principle.  If I were some kind of mage (which I'm not), a
harmless piece of lint might have been all I needed to turn
everyone in the barracks into fruitbats.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>While I was reattaching my money pouch to my belt, the
sergeant who interrogated me strode in.  His face hardened when
he saw me; I assumed he wasn't happy about my being released,
perhaps on the theory that everyone must be guilty of something.
That's the Harmonium for you.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"So they're letting you walk," he said after a long glare in
my direction.  "Don't get cocky about it, Cavendish.  You and
that Clueless friend of yours better stay out of trouble--I'm
keeping an eye on you both."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I don't suppose you could keep your eye on Hezekiah in the
barracks here...just long enough to give me a ten minute
headstart?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Trying to give him the slip, eh?"  The sergeant stroked his
beard thoughtfully.  "If you were a crook, Cavendish--and of
course I know you're not, you're a gentleman with friends in high
places who can spring you from choky even when it makes more
sense to keep you locked up--but if you were a crook, I'd think
you might be trying to beat your partner-in-crime to something.
Maybe race off to a case where you've stashed some jink, and
clear it out before the boy can stop you."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I stared at him in disbelief.  "Sergeant, you've missed your
calling.  Say the word and I'll put you in touch with some
friends of mine in the publishing trade; they're always looking
for bloods with a flair for fiction.  In the meantime, good night
to you."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>My words were wasted.  I intended to turn my back on him with
a lofty air and make my way out of the barracks, surrounded by an
air of wounded dignity.  Unfortunately, the sergeant had scuttled
off before I finished speaking, so I was left addressing the end
of my speech to an empty doorway.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I finished arranging my money pouch and started toward the
main doors of the building.  As I've mentioned, it was a busy
night in the barracks, with guards running to and fro, alone or
in packs that completely blocked the corridor.  They were in a
hurry and I was in a hurry; but they had truncheons and swords,
so I was the one who flattened against the wall to let them pass.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Still, I eventually made it to the door and out into the stale
midnight air of Sigil.  I stopped on the front steps to take a
breath, free once more...and at that moment, the sergeant bustled
out of the building with Hezekiah in tow.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"There you are, Cavendish!" the sergeant called.  "Aren't you
forgetting your friend?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Hi!" the boy chirped, holding out his knuckly hand for me to
shake.  "Good thing we managed to catch you before you got away."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Oh yes," I said glumly.  "Such a good thing."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>At the bottom of the steps, Hezekiah waved a cheery farewell
to the sergeant.  The sergeant waved back, but his beady little
eyes gleamed in my direction, like a whist player who's just
produced an unexpected trump.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Nice people, these guards," Hezekiah said, oblivious to the
exchange of glances between me and the sergeant.  "I offered to
buy them a round of drinks at their favorite tavern, but they
must be too busy investigating the fire."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"If you're interested in nightlife," the sergeant put in,
"stick with Cavendish.  I overheard Lady Erin tell him to meet
her at the Civic Festhall."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"The Civic Festhall?" Hezekiah asked, perky with interest.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Thank you very much, sergeant," I growled.  "Isn't it time
you served and protected someone else?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>He bowed smirkingly to me.  "Good night, Cavendish.  I'm sure
you two will enjoy yourselves."  Chuckling to himself, he
sauntered back into the barracks.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"The Civic Festhall?" Hezekiah repeated, grabbing my arm.  "Is
that some rundown ginmill frequented by rogues and vermin?
Because while I'm in Sigil, I'd love to visit a den of iniquity."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"The Civic Festhall is not a den of iniquity," I snapped.
"Just because it's run by Sensates, people make up the most
ridiculous rumors.  Look, I'll show you."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I pulled him into the middle of the street where we had a good
clear view of the sky.  As I've mentioned before, Sigil doesn't
have the kind of sky you get in mundane worlds.  Sigil is round
like a wheel: the inside rim of a wheel roughly twenty miles
around.  When you look up, you peer through the sooty air to see
the opposite side of the city five miles overhead; and from where
we stood outside the City Barracks, the brightest light in the
night sky was the Civic Festhall.  It shone with a welcoming
yellow glow, and all around it were hundreds of other lights,
beaming from music halls, cafes and, yes, the occasional
bordello, all to entertain citizens with more varied tastes than
getting bubbed up in some grimy alehouse that waters the beer.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"That," I said, pointing, "is the Civic Festhall.  That is
where you go for opera, or symphony concerts, or performing
bears.  It has three art galleries, the finest museum of
antiquities in the multiverse, and an arena where you can go
every night for a year and never see the same sport twice.  If
you want to drink, the central bistro can sell you a wine so
delicate it evaporates before it even touches your tongue; it can
also sell you rotgut so potent, not only will you stay drunk for
the rest of your life, but so will your children and their
children.  Does that give you some idea of what the place has to
offer?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"The Civic Festhall," Hezekiah murmured in a thoughtful tone
of voice.  "Uncle Toby says there's a place where women..."  He
leaned over and whispered in my ear.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Oh," I said, "that's the half-time show in the arena.  Why do
you think people sit and watch all those sports they've never
seen before?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Then let's get a move on!" the boy whooped; and he started
off down the street, with the lights of the Festhall sparkling in
his eye.
</p>

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>On a normal night, I never would have walked the streets of
Sigil without my father's rapier hanging at my hip--even the
best-lit boulevards have footpads and worse hiding in the side
alleys.  However, only the Guvners and Harmonium could wear
swords into the City Courts, so I had reluctantly left my weapon
at home when I headed out to my painting assignment.  Now,
crossing the city at midnight, I could feel eyes watching me from
every shadow.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Fortunately, the Harmonium was out in force that night: guards
standing at every major corner, and others scurrying hither,
thither, and yon on unknown errands.  Speaking of guards, I
noticed a burly dwarf woman (at least I think it was a woman;
it's hard to tell with dwarves) dogging our heels about five
lampposts back.  She wasn't wearing the official neckerchief, but
she had the unmistakable trudging walk that marked her as a
Harmonium patroller.  No doubt this dwarf was a plainclothes gift
from my friend, the sergeant--someone to watch in case I gave
Hezekiah the slip and ran off on an unbridled crime spree.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The more I thought about it, however, the wiser it seemed to
keep Hezekiah close at hand.  He and I had witnessed a theft that
might be part of a city-wide conspiracy.  If I left him to his
own devices, he'd soon find himself one of those "dens of
iniquity" where he'd spill everything he knew to the assembled
company of cross-traders and bawds.  Word would travel through
the seedy parts of Sigil, eventually reaching the ears of the
thieves we'd seen that afternoon.  Maybe they wouldn't care that
they'd been spotted; but maybe they'd decide it was prudent to
silence those who could identify them.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah would get his throat cut first.  Then they'd come for
me.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>When I looked at the situation in that light, Hezekiah had to
be kept under wraps--for his own safety, as well as mine--and
that meant I had to play his minder until I could shuck off the
responsibility on someone else.  Maybe when I spoke with Lady
Erin later in the evening, I could persuade her to find a more
willing babysitter.
</p>

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>With so many guards roaming the streets, we made it to the
Festhall without incident...barring the half dozen times I had to
pull Hezekiah away from draggle-tail ladies of the evening.  Of
course, the little Clueless didn't understand what they meant by,
"Hey bloods, want a bit of lather?"; he grew more and more
convinced that Sigil was filled with 24-hour public baths.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Pulling Hezekiah through the outer approaches to the Festhall
was even harder.  Admittedly, I couldn't hold that against him;
from conjurors to lutists to acrobats, the walkways of the
Festhall are crammed with charming and talented performers,
highly skilled in capturing a newcomer's attention.  I noticed my
companion dipping frequently into his purse to find coins to drop
in the buskers' bowls--so frequently and with so many coins, I
began to wonder how much money Hezekiah had.  For that matter, I
wondered how so much silver managed to come from such a slim
little purse.  Perhaps that was another bit of magic from the
famed Uncle Toby.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>As we continued to pass singers and jugglers and
contortionists, I began to feel guilty about hurrying the boy off
to Lady Erin's office.  This was Hezekiah's first visit to the
Festhall; he should have a chance to experience everything he
could...provided I found some way to keep him out of real
trouble.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Casting about for a solution to my quandary, I caught sight of
a familiar face and waved her over to us.  Lillian fa Liranill
was thirty-two like me; but since she was an elf, she was still
an adolescent and she gloried in it.  The two of us had joined
the Society of Sensation in the same group ceremony, and we had
enjoyed a brother/sister relationship ever since.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lillian was more than just lively and delightful; she was
infinitely delightable, taking bubbly pleasure even in the
plainest, most humdrum aspects of existence.  I once watched her
write a letter to a friend, pausing every three seconds to ponder
what color of ink to use for the next word...and no matter what
color she chose, she always giggled at the effect.  For a
cherubically cheerful guide to the enticements of the Festhall,
you couldn't do better than Lillian.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>She wasn't half bad as an artist's model either.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Lil," I said, raising my voice to be heard above a pair of
nearby drummers, "this is Hezekiah Virtue.  He's just new to
Sigil."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Really!"  Her eyes opened wide.  "You're just new to Sigil?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Yes ma'am," the boy gulped, "I'm just new."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Glad we've got that clear," I said.  "I was wondering, Lil,
if you'd like to show Hezekiah some of the sights of the
Festhall."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Her eyes opened even wider.  "He'd like to see some of the
sights?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Yes ma'am," Hezekiah assured her, "I've been really looking
forward to seeing the sights."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps you could show him around," I suggested to Lillian.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Her eyes opened wider still; Lillian's eyes had the gift of
being infinitely expandable.  "Would you like me to show you
around?" she asked Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I'd love for you to show me around," he answered.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Then it's settled," I said.  Drawing Lillian aside, I
whispered, "Hezekiah went through a terrible ordeal this
afternoon, and it would do him good to forget about the
experience for a while.  Can you make sure he doesn't dwell on
what happened?  Don't let him start talking about it, to you or
anyone else.  Keep his mind on other things."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I can keep his mind on other things," she promised with those
wide open eyes of hers.  Turning back to Hezekiah, she slipped
her arm around his waist and snuggled in close to him.  "What do
you want to see first?" she asked.  "There's so much we can do."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Trying not to chuckle, I headed off to Lady Erin's offices.
Hezekiah would never know what hit him.
</p>

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The factol's suite was tucked into the most inaccessible part
of the Festhall, guarded by one of those irascible old men who
never goes anywhere, yet seems to know everything.  You know the
type: think of that local tavern owner who never strays farther
than the wine cellar...but if you witness some duel in the
streets and race around to tell the news, he already knows the
details, he can explain what started the quarrel in the first
place, and he even tells you the prognosis from the surgeon
attending the wounded.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lady Erin's steward, TeeMorgan, was like that.  He was a
bariaur--much like a centaur, but from the chest down he looked
more like a ram than a horse, and he had curled ram's horns
sprouting from his forehead.  "So," he said the moment he caught
sight of me, "you were in the middle of that fiasco in the Courts
today.  You and that Clueless boy.  Have you thrown him down a
privy or what?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Lillian has taken him under her wing," I answered.  "Do you
have any food handy?  I haven't eaten since lunch."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Hmph," he grumped.  "Seems to me if a Sensate wants to
experience everything in life, starvation is one of the first
things on the list."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I fasted for a month and a half the year I turned twenty-
five," I told him.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And the paintings you did then were your only ones worth
looking at," he retorted.  "All these portraits and landscapes
and still-lifes of yours...whatever happened to good old
abstraction?  Painting what you feel instead of what you
see--that's what I call art.  Where's the point of painting a
bowl of grapes that just looks like a bowl of grapes?  But put
little screaming faces on each grape, and that's a statement."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I wouldn't mind some grapes right about now," I said.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Yeah, try to change the subject.  But take your portrait of
Factol Sarin hanging in the City Barracks...my four-year-old
could understand it.  You call that art?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I call it my job.  People pay me to paint pictures that look
like pictures, TeeMorgan.  They don't come to me for statements,
they come for grapes you can recognize as grapes.  Judging by the
amount of gold they're willing to pay, they're happy with what
they get."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Oh yes, gold," TeeMorgan growled.  "You're a Sensate,
Cavendish--you should acquire a taste for more than one mineral.
What would your father think of a son who was content to be a
mediocrity?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I caught my breath and bit back true anger.  TeeMorgan and I
frequently had these jousting matches about art, but mentioning
my father was going too far.  The look on my face must have told
the bariaur he'd entered forbidden territory, because he turned
away and made a gruff noise in his throat.  "Pike all this
arguing," he said.  "I'll check what we've got in the pantry."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>His hoofs clacked loudly as he cantered into a back room; and
I was left alone with thoughts of my father.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>My father, Niles Cavendish, was a hero: a champion swordsman,
a dashing adventurer, a savior of the downtrodden.  A city like
Sigil never lacks for heroes, of course--every night in every
tavern, you'll hear some berk boasting how he slew the Five-
Headed Monster of Whatsit or retrieved the Gold Talisman of Who-
Cares.  But Niles Cavendish was a real hero, a hero known for his
exploits throughout the multiverse...ready to rush into the Abyss
to rescue a kidnapped princess, or dive into the River Styx to
save a drowning puppy.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Twelve years had passed since he disappeared, and I still
couldn't think about him without clenching my hands into fists.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>TeeMorgan stuck his head in from the pantry doorway.  "We got
some cold beef left over from dinner, and a new delicacy called
swineberries.  I assume you want some?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Beef yes, berries no."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And you call yourself a Sensate," TeeMorgan muttered.  He
stomped off to get me a plate.
</p>

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
< align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lady Erin arrived just as a nearby clock chimed six in the
morning.  I had been dozing lightly on a couch in her office, an
exotic piece of furniture upholstered with a hide I suspected had
once been attached to a basilisk.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Don't be gettin' up," she said as she bustled in and threw a
stack of papers onto her desk.  "I've only a few words to say,
then I'll let you get back to sleep.  You'll need all the rest
you can get."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"May I ask why, my lady?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Special duty in the service of our faction," she replied.
"I've convinced the other factols someone's systematically
attacking all our faction headquarters.  Naturally, it's too much
to expect that we band together against a common foe..."  She
threw a rueful glance over her shoulder in the general direction
of the Hall of Speakers.  "But we've worked out a tiny
cooperative effort.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Each faction," she went on, "will protect its headquarters
however it sees fit.  Here at the Festhall, we'll have to hire
mercenaries, and won't that add to the cheery atmosphere?  But
that's not your problem.  The council also agreed to assemble
cross-factional teams of observers outside each headquarters--not
helpin' with protection but watchin' for suspicious activities.
If an attack or disaster takes place, the teams are forbidden to
involve themselves; we don't want them gettin' distracted by a
showy diversion.  Observer teams'll hold back and look smaller
things...like a githyanki and githzerai runnin' out the back door
of the building."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I assume you want me on one of these teams?" I said.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Exactly," she nodded.  "You have a keen eye, and you've seen
the thieves.  That's an advantage I don't want to waste.  Also, I
understand you can take care of yourself if it comes to a
fight...right?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>She smiled at me as if that were a joke--as if we both knew
that the son of Niles Cavendish had to be a formidable warrior.
Surely my father taught me all his fighting tricks.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>No.  He taught me nothing.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>For months, sometimes years at a time, the legendary
adventurer simply wasn't home: off swashbuckling through the
multiverse, leaving my mother and me to struggle through on our
own.  When he came home his pockets were full of gold; but after
a brief splurge of gift-giving, he would spend the rest of his
purse on equipment for his next foray, leaving us alone again
with nothing.  Yes, I did learn to use the rapier, but not from
my father.  I learned my skills, such as they are, from dearly
hired swordmasters--in my youth, because I thought learning the
sword would impress my father if he ever took the time to notice,
then later because so many brash young bashers believed they
could make their reputations by challenging a Cavendish.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>On the eve of my twentieth birthday, the survivors of my
father's last expedition brought his rapier back and told us he
was "lost"...not killed for certain, just lost.  Vanished without
a trace, one night in the Outlands.  And even though we knew he
had to be dead, my mother and I still couldn't shake off the slim
hope he might one day show up on the doorstep, smiling, charming,
full of stories.  Year after year we hoped; until now, after
twelve years, hope had become a tired thing that only
occasionally returned to torment us, when a stranger's voice or
walk suddenly brought to mind the great flamboyant Niles.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lost is worse than dead.  But I had my father's rapier, and
yes, I did know how to fight.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I can protect myself," I told Lady Erin.  "If it comes to
that."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"We hope it doesn't," she nodded.  "If you catch sight of
those thieves again, don't go tryin' anything brave; just follow
them back to their base of operations.  Once we know where they
are...well, this group has killed people from four different
factions, so we'll have no problem findin' volunteers to rip the
berks to pieces."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"How much do the other factions know?" I asked.  "Did you tell
them the attack at the court building was just a diversion for
the theft?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Lady Erin shook her head.  "I didn't want to give away the
dark in an open meeting.  Not that I think any factol is behind
this, but some of those berks have notoriously loose lips.
They've agreed the observation teams should track suspicious
persons, and that's enough.  We'll make sure each team has a
Sensate, Guvner, or Harmonium guard who knows the chant and is
watchin' for the right things."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"So there won't be someone from each faction on every team?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"Heaven forbid!" she laughed grimly.  "I'm aimin' for five or
six people per team.  With so much distrust between factions,
it'll be hard enough to get a half dozen sods to work together
without comin' to blows; representin' all fifteen factions would
make the job impossible.  I have firsthand experience--I've just
come from a meetin' of all fifteen factions."  She gave a rueful
grin.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"So these teams..." I said.  "You'll want us watching twenty-
four hours a day?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>She nodded.  "Each faction'll set up an observation post for
you, somewhere with a good close view of the headquarters
building.  Runners'll bring you regular meals-- on the sly, of
course, so the enemy doesn't notice.  It'll be up to the teams to
decide who sleeps when, but there should be at least two people
peelin' an eye for trouble at all times."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"And we keep watching until something happens."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"You keep watchin' until you have to stop."  Lady Erin walked
around to the well-padded chair behind her desk, and slumped into
it wearily.  "Joint efforts between factions never last long,
Britlin.  Minor differences become major squabbles, arguments
become brawls, and eventually you get duels, fights, puttin' each
other in the dead-book...the factols all promise to pick their
most 'tolerant' people, but still I'd guess we have three days
tops before the operation falls apart.  If even one team gets out
of hand, it'll spike our try at secrecy and the enemy'll know
what we're up to.  So," she said, "you keep watching till you or
some other team blows the dark.  After that, there's no point."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Three days.  Three days out of my schedule, with the deadline
for Guvner Hashkar's commission coming up.  Since the first
painting had burned in the fire, I'd have to start again from
scratch...but then, if Guvner Hashkar wanted a picture of the
rotunda as it looked now, I could just smear black paint all over
the canvas.  There was a statement for you.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>Anyway, I had no choice--a man doesn't refuse a special
assignment from his factol.  In the morning, I'd ask Lady Erin to
send a note to Hashkar, regretfully stating he'd have to find
some other wedding present for his wife's cousin.
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>There was, however, one more matter that had to be handled
tonight.  "What about Hezekiah?" I asked.  "We can't let him
rattle his bone-box all around the city if we're trying to keep
this business dark."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>"I've been thinkin' about that," Lady Erin answered, "and it
strikes me it's high time Outsiders were allowed to play a more
active role in city politics.  At the last census, they
outnumbered every established faction in Sigil...includin' the
Chaosmen who all filled out five census forms apiece.  Such a
hefty number of folks deserve representation in some way; and
postin' Hezekiah to an observation team strikes me as the perfect
first step."
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>I winced.  "Whose team did you have in mind?"
</p><p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The factol just smiled.

3. THREE DAYS WITH THE DEAD
</font></p>
<p align=left>
</p><p align=left>The sky had begun to brighten when I let myself into Cavendish
Case--a two-storey flagstone house only a few blocks from the
Festhall.  My father had bought this place the day I was born, as
he never tired of telling me: one of the few topics of
conversation between us that didn't dwindle into awkward silence.
</p><p align=left>I had intended to slip inside quietly, pick up some things I
would need for the next few days, then slip out again.  Of
course, I'd leave my mother a note explaining that I'd be gone
for a while...and of course, I wouldn't tell her the truth.
Something like, "Urgent commission for the Modron
Ambassador--must stay at Mechanus embassy till finished."  That
would please her and avoid the unpleasantness of lying to her
face...
</p><p align=left>...except that she was standing in the front hall as I slunk
inside.
</p><p align=left>"And did we make a special friend last night?" she asked
sweetly.
</p><p align=left>"No, Mother."
</p><p align=left>"Britlin," she said, "a gentleman's only civilized excuse for
staying out till dawn is if he spent the night with a lady.  All
other alternatives are dclass."
</p><p align=left>"Yes, Mother."
</p><p align=left>She gave me a winsome smile--Mother had somehow convinced
herself I was accumulating a long string of romantic conquests.
The truth was much more restrained: yes, there had been a handful
of women (and one or two of those had been quite a handful!) but
I was no dashing rake with my head on a different pillow every
night.  Some Sensates strive for quantity and others for quality;
I preferred the second approach.
</p><p align=left>"And what is the news on the street today?" she asked, a
question that came up every morning.  I rattled off juicy tidbits
of rumor about the high and mighty--who was sleeping with whom,
who had gone bankrupt in the latest financial scandal, whose
souls had been collected overnight by baatezu calling in
contractual obligations--a grab-bag of gossip related to me by
TeeMorgan when he brought me breakfast at the Festhall.  Mother
had never met any of the people I talked about, but she nodded
knowingly at each blunder and impropriety.  The names were
unimportant; she simply loved to hear about folly.
</p><p align=left>She loved to sing about it too.  My mother Anne wasn't exactly
a bard--she never played for anyone outside the family--but she
wrote witty little songs that were then bought by practicing
bards from every ward of Sigil.  Although Mother didn't know it,
the performers always presented the songs as "classical tunes,
written in days long past"...mostly to explain why the verses
were written in such courtly language.  My mother, in songs as in
life, genteelly avoided the slang of the street.
</p><p align=left>It was a strange occupation for a woman born the daughter of a
duke; but then, she had long ago abandoned her heritage, and good
riddance to it.  Her father Urbin, Duke of Aquilune on some petty
Prime world, had been a brutal man, a bully who beat his wife to
death and then moved on to his daughter.  Anne suffered untold
agonies at his hands-- untold to me, anyway--but tiny hints over
the years suggested Urbin had raped her on numerous occasions,
loaned her to his friends for sport, and degraded her in every
conceivable way...all of this beginning when she was about eight
years old and continuing till the time she turned sixteen.
</p><p align=left>On the very day of Anne's sixteenth birthday, a young
swordsman named Niles Cavendish arrived at Duke Urbin's castle.
Bitter though I was at my father for never being home, I could
never truly hate him: in the first heroic act of his excessively
heroic career, Niles Cavendish had proved himself a saint by
saving Anne from her misery.  As a child, I believed he had
actually killed my wicked grandfather...but the Niles of that day
was not such a legendary warrior that he could single-handedly
slay a well-guarded duke in the heart of his castle.  Niles saved
Anne by marrying her, then bringing her back to his hometown of
Sigil; and if he won Urbin's permission to wed by holding a
rapier to the old berk's throat, neither of my parents would say.
</p><p align=left>So how does a woman leave behind such a hellish childhood to
become a writer of comic songs?  One day at a time.  It helped
that I was born shortly after she arrived in Sigil--taking care
of a baby occupied so much of her attention, she had no time for
ugly memories.  It helped that my father was constantly away
adventuring: she could concentrate entirely on her child, without
having to coddle a husband too.  Sometimes to quiet me, she
played the harpsichord my father gave her as a wedding gift; and
in time, she began to write little songs to greet him when he
finally came home...songs that my father encouraged her to write
down, songs that he showed to his bard friends who said they were
worth money...
</p><p align=left>A happy ending, some would say.  Some who had never seen the
scar down my mother's cheek, made by a drunken uncle who wanted
to test a new dagger.  Some who had never seen the empty
eyesocket that she refused to explain.  Some who didn't know that
in the thirty-two years she'd lived in Sigil, Anne Cavendish had
never stepped outside the house or seen another face besides my
father and me.  Before I was old enough to do the shopping,
delivery boys dropped food into a chute out front and Mother
shoved their payment through a slot in the door.  Even when she
began to sell her songs, she couldn't bear to meet customers--one
of Father's friends acted as her agent, picking up sheet music
left on the front stoop and sliding the proceeds under the door.
</p><p align=left>In short, Mother laughed, she told jokes, she was utterly
charming...but even I couldn't venture too close without making
her flinch.
</p><p align=left>We blew each other a lot of kisses.
</p><p align=left>"I should tell you," I said when I finally ran out of gossip,
"I won't be around for a few days.  Maybe as long as a week."
</p><p align=left>"Good for you, Britlin!" she beamed.  "Whoever you met last
night must be ravenous for more."
</p><p align=left>"It's not a woman, Mother..."
</p><p align=left>"A man then?  I'm broadminded.  Is he cute?"
</p><p align=left>"It's...an assignment.  A painting assignment."
</p><p align=left>"I see: painting."  She said it with a sly wink, as if she
knew that couldn't possibly be the truth.
</p><p align=left>Sometimes, I had to reflect how lucky I was my mother never
got out of the house.  Otherwise, she'd bring home a different
woman to meet me every night, desperately wanting her son to be
showered with constant, all-consuming adoration.  I was her
substitute, a stand-in who might find the kind of passion she
dreamed of: not Duke Urbin's bestial lust; not my own father's
heroic pity; "a soul-completing love, a mutual cherishment to
make weak hearts brave."
</p><p align=left>That last bit was from one of her songs.
</p><p align=left>"I have to pack some things," I told her.
</p><p align=left>"By all means," she replied.  "A gentleman always takes
appropriate precautions."
</p><p align=left>I laughed and shook my head.  Some days, my mother had an
unshakably one-track mind.  As I began to climb the stairs, she
called after me, "Wear the brown jacket, dear, and those nice
black pants.  They make you look so handsome, your lady will peel
off your clothes with her teeth."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>When I returned to the Festhall, I was wearing my father's
best rapier, and carrying a sketchbook to while away my off-hours
for the next few days.  Just inside the door, a factotum gave me
a note from Lillian (every word a different color), saying I
could find Hezekiah in an inn called She Who Sings the Sky.  The
place was just down Crystal Dew Lane and it had a good
reputation--more expensive than most but the price bought you a
good night's sleep without interruption by cracksmen or body-
baggers.  The next time I saw Lillian I'd have to congratulate
her for ensuring the boy's safety.
</p><p align=left>By the time I got to the inn, Hezekiah was awake and seated at
the breakfast table, munching through a stack of Outland pancakes
as tall as the Great Foundry's chimney.  For a moment I worried
he might have spilled some secrets to the other patrons eating
there; but the long-suffering woman cooking the pancakes said he
had talked about nothing but Lillian and the Festhall.
</p><p align=left>Indeed, that's all he spoke of the whole time he was finishing
his meal.  Lillian did this, Lillian said that; and had I ever
gone dancing along the Walk of Worlds?  (Hezekiah, I designed one
of the chambers along the walk-- the room depicting Pelion, a
layer of Arborea.  To prepare for the commission, I spent three
months in Pelion, slogging my way through an infinite expanse of
white sand, all the time muttering to myself, "How in The Lady's
name can I create a romantic little bower based on nothing but
desert?"  Still, a sphinx here, a pyramid there, and a few ruins
crumbling by candlelight did the trick...not to mention the
clever touch of posting signs that said PLEASE REMOVE ALL
FOOTWEAR.  Few couples can dance barefoot through soft warm sand
without longing to disappear together behind the nearest dune.)
</p><p align=left>Thus I listened to Hezekiah enthuse about my work as we left
the inn and walked out into the street.  It was a drizzly day in
Sigil, with raindrops so dainty you could ignore them until you
were soaked to the bone.  On the streets around us, most people
carried umbrellas and wore irritable expressions that grew more
sullen as the rain continued; but I and the other Sensates we
passed had our faces open to the wet, grinning as water streamed
down our cheeks.  There's an especially delightful moment when a
big droplet trickles down the back of your neck, so cold it makes
you squirm...yet it seems that Sensates are the only ones who
appreciate the experience.
</p><p align=left>Although our destination was almost diametrically across the
hub from the Festhall, we made the trip in well under an hour
thanks to Hezekiah's never-ending supply of gold: he simply hired
a hippogriff hansom to fly us straight across the ring.  For
once, the boy showed some common sense--we both spent the entire
trip with our heads stuck out the windows of the cab, lapping at
the brownish rainwater and enthusing over how far down it was to
the ground.  Whenever one of us shouted, "Look at that!" the
hippogriffs all gave fierce eagle-like screeches...which either
meant, "Yes, isn't it interesting?" or "Pipe down, you sodding
berks."
</p><p align=left>You never can tell with hippogriffs.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>In time, the cab set us down beside Ragpickers Square, in the
looming shadow of our destination--Sigil's Mortuary, headquarters
to the Dustmen.  Historians claim that five hundred years ago,
the Mortuary was nothing more than a massive granite dome, shaped
like a beehive; but since that time the Dustmen have expanded and
embellished, adding side towers and outbuildings, plus a frenzy
of ornamentation around the dome itself.  Now there are bat-
winged gargoyles mounted in a circle around the peak, and
trellises of razorvine growing up the walls; now, the front
entrance is flanked by giant frescoes depicting all the Death
Deities of the multiverse; and now the crowning glory above the
entrance is a stained glass window, two storeys tall, fifty feet
wide.  Every pane of glass in that window is a subtly different
shade of black.
</p><p align=left>"Wow!" said Hezekiah.  "What a great-looking place!  I bet
it's spooky at night.  Do they give tours?"
</p><p align=left>"No," I answered, "they give funerals."
</p><p align=left>Although it was still before peak, several mourning parties
stood queued outside the main door, suggesting that the dozen
ceremony rooms inside were already occupied.  I wondered how many
of the corpses lined up for the final send-off were victims of
the massacre at the Courts yesterday.  No way to tell.  Each
corpse would be taken inside, prepared according to whatever
rituals were desired by the next of kin, and finally launched
through portals into other planes of the multiverse--to a heaven
or a hell if the deceased had shown a preference during life, or
maybe just to the Elemental Plane of Fire for instant cremation.
</p><p align=left>"Excuse me, honored sir," said a voice by my side.</p><p align=left>"Would
you have the privilege to be Britlin Cavendish?"
</p><p align=left>I turned to see a sallow-faced gnome kowtowing in the vicinity
of my ankles.  He wore a shapeless gray robe that was much too
long for him; probably, it had been tailored for a short human,
which meant that fully half of it piled up in folds around his
three-foot-tall frame.  The collar of his robe bore a tiny
embroidered skull in the faded yellow and orange colors of the
Dustmen.
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I replied, "I'm Britlin Cavendish.  And this is
my...this is Hezekiah Virtue."
</p><p align=left>"An honor, an honor," the gnome said, taking Hezekiah's hand
in both of his own and squeezing repeatedly.  "You may call me
Wheezle--everybody does.  If I ever had another name, I've
forgotten it by now."
</p><p align=left>He gave a little laugh as if we should take this as a joke.
For politeness' sake I smiled, but his attitude didn't fool me.
Gnomes in Sigil place great stock on their names, and most of
them take pride in introducing themselves at length, complete
with genealogies and incomprehensible honorifics: "I have the
privilege to be Quando-Master Spurrit Vellosheen Legrunner,
eldest son of Jance-Leader Vellosheen Spurrit Legrunner, late of
the Order of the Vole, but recently advanced to the House of
Frequent Bubbles, twice enwreathed."  If you meet a gnome who
only gives a nickname, he's either a criminal concealing his
identity or a wizard whose magic would be jeopardized by speaking
his name aloud.
</p><p align=left>"What can we do for you, Wheezle?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"No, honored Cavendish, it is what I can do for you," he
replied.  "My superiors instructed me to watch for you and escort
you to...a place nearby."
</p><p align=left>"A place we can keep an eye on the entrance to the Mortuary?"
</p><p align=left>"Indeed.  If you would walk this way?"
</p><p align=left>He gestured toward a tenement building across the
street...although calling it a building perhaps too generous.  It
looked more like a rickety piece of wooden sculpture, constructed
by an untalented art student who needed lessons in carpentry.
The only things propping it up were a line of equally seedy
tenements on either side, leaning inward so the building in the
middle had nowhere to fall.  Further structural reinforcement was
added by ample quantities of razorvine that twined up the front
face of the building in a solid sheet of thorns.
</p><p align=left>"You want us to go in there?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"It is an excellent location," Wheezle answered.  "As you can
see, its height gives it a superlative view; from the seventh
floor, you can observe the front entrance of the Mortuary and
much of the back.  Even better, the building has no tenants right
now."
</p><p align=left>"That's because it's going to collapse any second!"
</p><p align=left>"Factol Skall guarantees its structure is fundamentally
sound," Wheezle said.  "At least for a few days."
</p><p align=left>"It looks fine to me," Hezekiah chipped in.  "Come on,
Britlin, this will be fun."
</p><p align=left>Reluctantly, I followed the two of them toward the tenement.
Whether or not it was structurally sound, the building was made
from very old wood--the kind that would blaze like straw if our
flame-happy enemies pluffed it with a fireball.  Silently, I
whispered a prayer to The Lady of Pain that the drizzle would
keep falling until the wood became too wet to burn.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The design of the tenement was simple: two single-room
apartments on each floor, and a wobbly staircase up the middle.
Judging by the smell of the lobby, every apartment had once
housed a minimum of five weak-bladdered cats.
</p><p align=left>The doors of both ground-floor apartments were missing.  So
were the windows.  Rain pattered in from the outside, and ran
across the badly slanted floors to pool up in the corners.  In
spite of myself, I began to look forward to a few days in the
place--I had never stayed in such a decrepit building before.  If
I was lucky, it would even have rats.
</p><p align=left>The stairs creaked loudly as we started up to the higher
floors.  Wheezle tried to put this in a positive light.  "As you
can tell, your honors, we need not fear enemies creeping silently
up from below."
</p><p align=left>"We?" I asked.  "You'll be watching with us?"
</p><p align=left>"Factol Skall deemed it helpful for one of our faction to join
you," the gnome answered.  "In case you had any questions about
our ways."  Which meant that Factol Skall wanted his own man
planted in our party, to spy on us and report any undesirable
activities.  No doubt every other faction in the city was doing
the same thing.
</p><p align=left>We climbed all the way to the top, constantly brushing away
the filmy cling of spider webs.  The stairs teetered under our
weight and I made a point of staggering my footsteps not to match
Hezekiah and Wheezle--if we all walked in pace, we might give the
staircase a timed wobble that would bring the whole thing
crashing down.  It didn't help that the top flight of steps was
slick with water, dribbling in through dozens of holes in the
roof.  Much as the seventh floor afforded the best view of the
Mortuary, I suspected the team would prefer to set lookouts on
the sixth or even fifth floor...somewhere the rain couldn't
penetrate so easily.
</p><p align=left>Then again, when we reached the seventh floor, another member
of our party was already there, enduring the leaky roof with no
noticeable discomfort: Guvner Oonah DeVail, our brief
acquaintance from the Courts.  She had brought a folding canvas
chair with her, and now sat a short distance back from the
window, peering out into the street.  Her silver-wired staff
leaned up against the wall within easy grabbing distance.
</p><p align=left>"Fine morning, isn't it?" she asked.  She had managed to place
her chair out of the direct line of any of the leaks, but her
olive green bush-hat was still sodden with rain.  "How are you
two feeling?"
</p><p align=left>"Quite well, your honor," I bowed.
</p><p align=left>"Bar that nonsense!" she snapped.  "I'm on official leave from
the court bench, so you can skip the flowery titles.  My name is
Oonah, got it?  Oonah."
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah Virtue," my companion said, scuttling forward and
holding out his hand.  Whatever Prime backwater the boy came
from, they were certainly big on handshakes.  But DeVail was
happy to reciprocate, grabbing Hezekiah's hand and pumping it
heartily.
</p><p align=left>"Heard you two saved a library yesterday," she said.  "Bully
for you.  Top marks."
</p><p align=left>I tried to look suitably modest; Hezekiah just blushed.
</p><p align=left>"A thousand pardons, honored ones," Wheezle interjected, "but
I must return below to meet the other guests.  Good deaths to you
all."  He kowtowed and slipped away.
</p><p align=left>Since this might be our only moment alone with Judge DeVail, I
had to ask the vital question.  "Guvner," I said, then corrected
myself, "Oonah...have you figured out what the thieves took from
your office?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes and no," she replied in a low voice.  "I believe they
took a scroll written by my mother some forty years ago.  People
sometimes call me an explorer, but my mother Felice...she was ten
times the traveler I ever hoped to be.  In her lifetime she
touched on all the Outer Planes--all the heavens, all the
hells--as well as the Elemental Planes and more than a dozen
Prime Material worlds.  No one else ever rambled around the
multiverse like Felice did."
</p><p align=left>I might have countered that my father had easily matched
Felice DeVail's achievements; but I refused to play the pathetic
cast-off son, boasting on his dad's behalf.  Sometime, I would
have to find out if Niles had ever gone a'rambling with Oonah's
mother.
</p><p align=left>"When she died last year," DeVail continued, "Felice left me
her diaries: a treasure trove of stories and multiverse lore.  I
was slowly working my way through each scroll, indexing,
annotating, getting them ready for more extensive scholarly
research...and the sad truth is, I hadn't gotten around to the
scroll the thieves took.  I have no idea what was in it."
</p><p align=left>"The thieves said something about dust," Hezekiah said.
</p><p align=left>DeVail shrugged.  "If you know the right portal, you can get
to an entire universe of the stuff--the Quasielemental Plane of
Dust.  It's a flat sea of grit stretching infinitely in all
directions: no water, no truly solid ground...and no air in the
atmosphere, so no wind to disturb the dusty surface.  On top of
that, the dust is hungry; leave your armor unattended for a day,
and it'll disintegrate to dust too.  I've never been there, but
my mother visited once.  She hated it."
</p><p align=left>"And she didn't mention anything special about the plane?" I
asked.  "The thieves said she'd drawn a map.  Maybe a treasure
map?"
</p><p align=left>"I honestly don't know," Oonah answered.  "She was always
reluctant to talk about her travels...to talk about anything,
really.  My mother would much rather ferry down the River Styx
than make after-dinner conversation, even with close friends.
Self-effacing to a fault when she wasn't roving around the
wilds."
</p><p align=left>Maybe Felice DeVail didn't talk to her daughter, I thought,
but she must have talked to someone; otherwise, how did the
thieves know there'd be something interesting in the scroll?  Or
perhaps Oonah herself had talked about her mother where the wrong
ears could overhear.  However, before I could ask Oonah who knew
she had the diaries, the stairway shuddered with a flurry of
rattles and creaks.
</p><p align=left>"More company," the Guvner said.
</p><p align=left>Like a puppy, Hezekiah rushed to see who was coming.  A moment
later, he ran back to us.  "There are two of them with Wheezle,"
he whispered.  "And one is a tiefling."
</p><p align=left>I looked at Oonah.  She gave a noncommittal shrug and turned
her eyes toward the stairs.  No doubt, both of us knew a few
tieflings who weren't antisocial ruffians; but the vast majority
of their kind went through life in a state of ill-controlled
hostility, believing the world despised them and doing their best
to despise it back.
</p><p align=left>Why?  Just because they looked a bit different from normal
humans.  Nothing very obvious--maybe slightly feline eyes or a
curling prehensile tail, maybe dark greenish hair or a small set
of horns.  Some blamed these deviations on demon blood in the
family tree, but others said it was simply the price of life in
the wide open multiverse; once humans left the placid safety of
the Prime Material plane, their children occasionally developed
unusual traits.  I could see no shame in being a plane-touched
child...but the tieflings turned their tiny slivers of difference
into massive chips on their shoulders.
</p><p align=left>The tiefling coming up the stairs, for example--a young woman,
and a strikingly attractive one, even if she did have spiky
reptilian crests running up the flat of each forearm.  They were
nothing more than white bony ridges against the taffy brown of
her skin, easily mistaken for ornamental bracers if your eyes
weren't as sharp as mine; I'd happily hire a woman this lean and
lithe to pose in my studio.  However, the look on the tiefling's
face clearly stated she would never consent to be my model.  In
fact, she'd probably run me through with her longsword just for
suggesting it.  She wore a tight-fitting black sheath of genuine
dragon skin, and her hand rested lightly on the pommel of her
sword, as if she were just waiting for one of us to disparage her
race.
</p><p align=left>Embossed on the breast of the dragon skin was the horned skull
symbol of the Doomguard--just the sort of faction that attracted
tieflings.  The Doomguard held a "leave things alone" attitude
toward life; or more precisely, they had a dizzying passion for
entropy and would love nothing more than watching the multiverse
slowly grind to a halt.  They took offense at any interference
with the gradual dissolution of existence, whether you tried to
slow the disintegration through gratuitous creativity or speed it
up through aggressive destruction.  With the Doomguard's "keep
your hands off the world" philosophy, was it any wonder tieflings
found the faction in tune with their own feelings?
</p><p align=left>"Greetings again, honored ones," said Wheezle as he led the
newcomers toward us.  "May I introduce Yasmin Asparm of the
Doomguard, and Initiate Brother Kiripao of the Transcendent
Order?"
</p><p align=left>If tiefling Yasmin was a fireball waiting to explode, Brother
Kiripao was an icy mountain quivering on the verge of avalanche.
He was an elf, his age impossible to guess; and he moved with a
graceful serenity unusual even for one of his race.  With vibrant
green eyes, hair shaved clean off, a composed smile on his face
as he bowed to greet us...well, he intimidated me ten times more
than Yasmin.  There's something about a certain type of monk that
promises he can pummel you to pudding with his bare hands, all
the while discussing the delicate art of flower arrangement.  Not
that Brother Kiripao was completely unarmed--I noticed a shiny
black set of nunchakus tucked into his belt sash, and that didn't
put me at ease either.
</p><p align=left>Worst of all was his faction.  The Transcendent Order, also
called the Ciphers, subscribed to the belief that people thought
too much.  If we just stopped filling our heads with ideas, the
Order preached, we would become attuned to the harmony of the
multiverse.
</p><p align=left>In the abstract, I could sympathize with such a philosophy;
but in the real world, it meant that Ciphers always leaped before
they looked.  Their training taught that if they could just act
without thinking, they'd always do the right thing.  It gave them
chillingly fast reflexes, which made people like Brother Kiripao
invaluable in sudden emergencies when there was no time to debate
tactics.  However, it also meant they had no faith in measured
discussion or advance tactical planning--they believed
exclusively in the spur of the moment.
</p><p align=left>A hotheaded tiefling and a placid elf monk who could change in
a split-second to a fighting dervish...it was going to be a long
three days.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Throughout the afternoon, funeral processions continued to
arrive at the Mortuary.  Wheezle and I posted ourselves at a
window on the fourth floor to watch them--high enough to give us
a good view of the street, low enough that we could still make
out faces in the crowd.  Brother Kiripao and Hezekiah volunteered
for the drizzly watch up on the seventh floor; they were supposed
to concentrate their observations on the rear entrance and leave
the front to us.
</p><p align=left>Our final pair of companions, Yasmin and Oonah, had retired to
rest elsewhere in the building...probably in separate rooms.
Guvners and the Doomguard tend to view each other with suspicion:
Guvners spend their lives discovering new laws of the multiverse,
gauging their success in life by the number of laws they can
unearth; the Doomguard, on the other hand, only recognize the Law
of Entropy, and are quick to label the Guvners misguided fools
for believing anything else is important.  One law versus an
ocean of laws--a dispute that has come to blows on many
occasions.  It was just one example of the inter-faction tensions
that continually plague the city.
</p><p align=left>However, inter-faction relations don't always need to be
strained, even when the faction philosophies are diametrically
opposed.  Wheezle and I, Dustman and Sensate, had a splendid time
watching funerals pass beneath us.  As a Dustman, the little
gnome had an encyclopaedic knowledge of burial customs throughout
the multiverse, and he happily explained the actions of each
group who filed up to the Mortuary.  For example...
</p><p align=left>"What luck, honored Cavendish!  The next group of mourners
always brings special delight when one of their fellows dies.
They are orcs hailing from a Prime world whose name I am
regrettably unable to pronounce, and they have the charming
tradition of building their coffins in shapes that have special
meaning to the deceased.  You will observe that these particular
pallbearers carry a casket carved to look like a giant pink
trout.  Such a mischievous smile on its face...it must be quite a
happy fish."
</p><p align=left>"Do the orcs worship trout?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"No," Wheezle answered, "they simply like bright, eye-catching
coffins.  Existence is hard for orcs, even in Sigil where The
Lady's law of live-and-let-live gives them a degree of
protection.  Even here, orcs seldom enjoy the smallest luxury
during their lifetimes.  Therefore they build their own coffins
long before death approaches, choosing to make those coffins
silly or wanton or extravagant--the embodiment of some personal
fantasy that can soothe all grievance when their world is harsh.
Perhaps this particular orc once saw a rich man eating trout and
dreamed of being able to do the same; or perhaps the orc just
longed for the freedom to sit quietly on a river bank and catch
fish.  Who can say?  He chose a trout for his own reasons...and
throughout his difficult life, he often must have sat beside his
pink fish coffin and taken comfort that his death would wear a
cheerful face."
</p><p align=left>Talk like that gave me a greater appreciation of Wheezle, and
Dustmen in general.  Usually, one only thinks of them as a morbid
crew who preach that death is a state of ultimate purity,
something we should all work toward.  Indeed, they claim that
everyone in this world is dead already, that the entire
multiverse is the afterlife of some joyous existence elsewhere;
all of us must now undergo the agonizing transition from
exuberant life to peaceful death, and rejection of death in any
form simply makes our path more painful.
</p><p align=left>Needless to say, the Dustman philosophy doesn't sit well with
Sensates.  After all, we pride ourselves on being in love with
life, the painful parts as well as the pleasurable ones.  Most
Sensates kill themselves once or twice just to see what death
feels like...but we make piking sure we have a top-rate priest
standing by to raise us again once we've reaped all we can from
the experience.
</p><p align=left>Still, it was educational to hear Wheezle speak of death so
affectionately.  Much as I couldn't understand the attraction
myself, I always think fondly of people who've found their true
loves.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The rain tapered off toward nightfall.  The last of the
mourners vanished into the building, then hurried out again a few
minutes later--the Mortuary stands just inside the Hive slum
district, and it's not a safe place to tarry after dark.  When
night comes, thieves emerge from the shadows to work the old
cross-trade; and things blacker still stalk the thieves, for
Sigil is a city with many shades of darkness.
</p><p align=left>A figure emerged from the front doors of the Mortuary:
humanoid, but with eyes that burned like dull red embers.  It
carried a heavy burlap sack in one hand, but let its other hand
swing free, displaying a set of razor-sharp claws.  Even at this
distance, I could smell the stench of decaying flesh.
</p><p align=left>"Looks like a barrow wight," I whispered to Wheezle, as I
quietly drew my rapier.  "Nasty things--they can drain the life
right out of you.  How much do you want to bet the bad guys
carried the wight in earlier, pretending it was a corpse?  Then
the wight got out of its coffin when no one was looking and
filled that sack with treasures from your faction."
</p><p align=left>"It would be unethical to take your bet, honored Cavendish."
Wheezle gently laid his hand on my sword and lowering the blade.
"The wight's bag does not hold stolen treasure; it holds our
supper."  He went to the window and waved.  "Over here, Eustace,"
he called softly to the wight.  "I trust it is still hot?"
</p><p align=left>Eustace the Wight curled his lip and uttered a bone-chilling
hiss.  Wheezle went down to meet him at the door.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The six of us ate our dinner in darkness--lighting the
smallest candle might give away our position.  Hezekiah and I sat
by the window, keeping an eye on the Mortuary throughout the
meal.
</p><p align=left>"Brother Kiripao has been teaching me how to fight," Hezekiah
whispered to me.  He demonstrated a few jerky punches that came
perilously close to my nose.  "See?"
</p><p align=left>"Keep your wrists straight," I murmured.  A friend of my
father's had believed every well-bred gentleman needed skill in
the "manly" arts, so he'd spent several months training me in
sportsman-like boxing...not that Brother Kiripao was apt to fight
like a sportsman.
</p><p align=left>"And he's also been telling me about the Transcendent Order,"
Hezekiah went on.  "It's all about emptying your mind."
</p><p align=left>"You must have great potential," I said.
</p><p align=left>"Naw," the boy replied.  "I got all kinds of stuff in my head.
Special tricks and all.  From Uncle Toby."
</p><p align=left>"Good old Uncle Toby."
</p><p align=left>"You know," Hezekiah whispered, "until I came to Sigil, I
thought maybe Uncle Toby and I were the only people in the world
who could do special things.  Everybody back home was so boring.
But here...well, look at us all.  Oonah has her staff, Wheezle's
an illusionist, Yasmin and Brother Kiripao both have priestly
magic..."
</p><p align=left>"How do you know all that?" I interrupted.
</p><p align=left>He stared at me as if he didn't understand the question.  "I
just asked them," he said.
</p><p align=left>Disquieted, I glanced back at the other four in the room,
silently eating their suppers.  All four had magic at their
fingertips?  But then, they'd been hand-picked by their factols
for an important assignment; of course, they'd be the best their
factions had to offer.  And why had Lady Erin chosen me?  I
wasn't a wizard or a priest.  Yes, I could use a rapier, but
mostly I happened to be a witness, assigned to this team solely
because I might recognize the thieves.
</p><p align=left>Maybe I should just sketch the faces of the thieves, give the
pictures to my fellow team members, then head for home.  They
didn't need me; even Hezekiah had more tricks up his sleeve than
I did.  Mind you, I had one advantage the rest of them lacked: I
was completely sane.  Scowling Yasmin, placid Kiripao, clueless
Hezekiah, death-loving little Wheezle...even Guvner Oonah had her
barmy side, the way she rushed off for that showdown with three
homicidal fireballers.  If I left them all alone, who knew what
kind of catastrophes they'd cause without my moderating
influence?
</p><p align=left>Still, the idea of poor mundane Britlin surrounded by five
magic-wielding addle-coves...it rattled me.  Stepping away from
the window, I announced, "It's my turn to sleep.  Wake me at the
next shift change."  Without waiting for objections, I went down
the creaky stairs, laid my bedroll in the back of a fifth floor
room, and hoped I wouldn't lie awake too long.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Yasmin woke me as first light was dawning.  She loomed above
me, prodding my ribs repeatedly with her toe, and she didn't stop
until I snapped, "All right, all right.  I'm conscious."
</p><p align=left>"You're watching with me on the top floor," she said.  "I'll
see you up there."  As she went out the door, she paused and
turned back to me.  "You look innocent in your sleep.  And you
make little sounds."
</p><p align=left>Without another word she dashed away, and when she hit the
staircase, it clattered into a furore of squeaking.  I think she
was running up the stairs two at a time.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Needless to say, I wondered what I was getting into as I
stepped through the doorway of the upstairs room.  Yasmin's face
was slightly flushed, but whether that was exertion or a blush, I
couldn't tell.  She glanced at me only for a second, then turned
her eyes to the street outside the window.
</p><p align=left>"Anything happening out there?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>She shook her head, without shifting her gaze; for a street
with nothing going on, it certainly seemed to rivet her
attention.
</p><p align=left>Shrugging, I went to the corner of the room that held the
biggest puddle of rainwater...at least an inch deep in some
places, thanks to exaggerated warps in the wood of the floor.
Carefully, I wet my hands and patted them on my face for a
morning wash.  The water smelled of dirt and dust; little fibers
floated in it, either threads left behind by some carpet that had
once lain on this floor or hairs from rats nesting in the
building.
</p><p align=left>I crouched down and lapped up a bit of the puddle, just to see
if it tasted like rats, carpet, or something else.  The flavor
was mostly bland dust, with a slightly smoky tang to it.  Did
that come from Sigil's normal smog of chimney soot?  Or was I
tasting the residue of the fire that had burned through the Hive
earlier in the week?
</p><p align=left>"Did you just put your tongue on this filthy floor?" Yasmin
asked from her place by the window.
</p><p align=left>"Actually I just slurped up some rainwater," I replied.
"However, I'll happily lick the floor if you think the flavor's
worth it."
</p><p align=left>"Sensates!" she growled, and went back to looking out the
window.
</p><p align=left>Since she'd mentioned it, I did try licking the floor but it
didn't impress me.  Ordinary varnished cedar--I'd tasted much
better in my time.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>As the day brightened, traffic picked up on the streets below
us.  Since Yasmin and I were on the top floor, our job was to
look beyond the dome of the Mortuary (four storeys shorter than
our tenement perch) and scan the rear entrance for signs of
mischief.  Not that we could actually see the rear entrance--the
dome blocked our view--but we had a clear line of sight to the
street passing the backdoor.  Down there, members of the unclean
underclass called the Collectors were bringing in corpses who got
themselves put in the dead-book overnight: old bubbers who'd
choked on their own vomit, young ones who liked to pick tavern
fights, Clueless newcomers who wandered down the wrong alley.
Welcome to Sigil, you leatherheads.
</p><p align=left>Idly, I picked up my sketchbook, made a few sweeps with my
stick of charcoal, then put it down again.
</p><p align=left>"What's that you just drew?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"Nothing," I answered, holding up the page so she could see.
"For a moment I considered drawing a stark little
streetscape--the Mortuary, with wretched bands of Collectors
sneaking in corpses at the backdoor.  But I decided against it."
</p><p align=left>"Why?"
</p><p align=left>"Because people don't like depressing pictures."
</p><p align=left>"I do," Yasmin said.
</p><p align=left>"Yes, you probably do," I admitted.  "You and the whole
Doomguard.  And the Dustmen, and the Bleak Cabal, and maybe some
other factions too.  But my regular customers don't like
depressing pictures.  They'd hate seeing such pictures in my
studio, and they'd hate hearing that I'd sold such pictures
to...people who weren't like themselves."
</p><p align=left>"In other words," she sneered, "you're not going to draw
something that interests you, because some jink-jigging nobs
would disapprove."
</p><p align=left>"Disapproval's not the point," I replied.  "It's just that
whenever I pick up charcoal or paintbrush, I have two choices:
create something that earns money or waste my time on something
that doesn't.  A man has to be practical."  For my mother's sake,
I might have added--keeping up Cavendish Case was not cheap, but
it would kill her if we ever had to move out of the house.  Of
course, I wasn't prepared to talk about family with a complete
stranger like Yasmin; why should I care if she thought I was a
greedy self-centered berk?
</p><p align=left>Yasmin turned away to glare out the window, then reached into
a pocket of her dragon skin leotard and tossed me a worn gold
coin.  "There," she said.  "Special commission.  Draw what you
want, any way you want.  And I promise I won't tell your precious
customers you worked for a Doomguard tiefling."
</p><p align=left>I held the coin in my hand for several seconds, feeling the
warmth of the gold--a warmth that had come from Yasmin's body.
Then I lifted my sketchbook, flipped to a blank page, and started
sketching the clean lines of her face.  High forehead, strong
jaw, good cheekbones...an excellent artist's model, just as I
thought.
</p><p align=left>It was about the time I started trying to capture her eyes
that she finally recognized the picture on the paper.
</p><p align=left>"What do you think you're doing?" she snapped.
</p><p align=left>"Drawing something I want.  Now stop jerking your head like
that, so I can get on with the work.  I take commissions
seriously."
</p><p align=left>Like many first-time models, she started out self-conscious
and artificial, went through an irritable stage when she
threatened to quit every other minute, progressed to a state of
sullen resignation, and finally came to ignore me when she became
tired of forcing her face into "artistic" expressions.  That's
when I turned to a new page and began the real drawing.
</p><p align=left>And so the day passed.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Early on the third morning, an army of Collectors paraded down
the street with the stiffening corpse of a giant.
</p><p align=left>At the time, Oonah and Wheezle had the fourth floor watch,
while Yasmin and Hezekiah took the seventh floor.  It was just as
well Yasmin and I weren't together again--when she saw my final
drawing the day before, it had taken her aback, possibly because
it showed how strikingly lovely she was.  I had drawn her with
her chin resting thoughtfully on her fist, and the bony ridge of
her forearm was an integral part of the picture's composition.
She had never posed in that position, certainly not during the
day we'd been together, and possibly never in her life; but even
I was surprised how strongly it captured who she was.  For
several long minutes after I had finished it, I didn't want to
let it out of my hands.  I wanted to hold it, memorize what I had
done...or maybe throw it in the faces of critics who derided my
portraits as shallow.
</p><p align=left>Still, a commission was a commission, and Britlin Cavendish
never peeled his clients.  Carefully, bashfully, I handed it to
Yasmin.  She never said a word; she simply stared at it a long
long time.
</p><p align=left>After that, we both shied away from each other's company for a
while--it felt too awkward.  I decided to ask Hezekiah to take
the next day's watch with Yasmin; his Clueless questions would
irritate her, but she might be more at ease being annoyed than
handling whatever emotions she felt the day before.
</p><p align=left>With the other four team members on watch, Brother Kiripao and
I had little to do.  After two days in the tenement, I had
endured enough of its quaking stairs and musty smell; so I found
myself on the ground floor, staring out at the street and
wondering how risky it would be to go for a walk in Sigil's
version of fresh air.  Brother Kiripao may have been thinking the
same thing, for he wandered down to join me, gazing out the
glassless window.
</p><p align=left>We could hear the giant's approach several minutes before the
corpse actually came into view: the sound of overloaded carts
groaning along the cobblestones, mingled with the grunts of
people lugging a heavy burden.  Then, around the corner came a
haycart supporting the giant's head and shoulders, his long wild
hair tumbling over the sides of the cart and trailing along the
street.  The hair was green, and his skin sulphur yellow--a
jungle giant, if I correctly remembered Kreepatch's Guide to the
Multiverse.  Sigil didn't have a large population of giants, but
a few happened into the city from time to time, and they
naturally stood out in the crowd.  Jungle giants were one of the
more civilized species, smart and self-disciplined enough to stay
out of trouble.
</p><p align=left>The giant in front of us, however, had not been quite smart
enough.  His throat sported a long red gash, still dribbling
blood onto the pavement...enough blood to satisfy a string of
dogs who trotted along beside the corpse to lick up the spillage.
For a moment, I thought the deceased must have been killed by one
of his fellow giants--who else is tall enough to slit a giant's
throat?  But then, a random breeze blew in through the window and
filled my nostrils with an overpowering stink of cheap whiskey.
</p><p align=left>Whiskey had soaked into the giant's hair...whiskey clung to
his beard and his meagre clothing...whiskey formed a visibly
sticky coat on his bare skin.  The giant must have bathed in the
stuff, or poured a dozen bottles over his head.  The obvious
conclusion was that he'd been celebrating something; a marriage
perhaps, or one of his people's religious festivals.  I could
picture him drenching himself liberally with whiskey, externally
and internally, then bumbling off into the city and passing out
in some alley.  If a robber wandered by, the thief might well do
a slice-job on the giant's throat before picking his pockets--you
wouldn't want a drunken giant to wake up while you were bobbing
his money pouch.
</p><p align=left>The breeze blew in at me again.  Stale rotgut whiskey: I knew
the aroma well, just as I knew the bouquets of the finest wines.
And yet, there was something slightly odd...
</p><p align=left>"Warn the others to stay on their toes," I told Brother
Kiripao.  "I have to check something out."
</p><p align=left>Tossing off my jacket, I rumpled my hair and pulled out my
shirt tails to bring my appearance more into line with street
fashion in the Hive.  Then with a drunken swagger, I stumbled out
the door and up to the passing giant.  "Sure is a big piking
basher!" I called out to the nearest Collector.
</p><p align=left>"He's a heavy sod, all right," the Collector replied.  Sweat
poured down her face as she helped push her cart, but the woman
seemed cheerful enough.  "I like the heavy ones," she went on.
"When the Dustmen hand out jink for collecting stiffs, they pay
by the pound."
</p><p align=left>"You'll be rich, you rotten berk!"  She and I both laughed
loudly.  I let the laugh break into a cough and staggered up
against the corpse to steady myself.  With a little squirming, I
managed to change position so my nose was flush against the
giant's skin.  One good whiff, and I backed away a few paces.
</p><p align=left>"Where'd you find this big old jumbo?" I asked the Collector.
</p><p align=left>"Lying in an alley," she said.  "Where else?  He got drunk, he
got sliced...simple as that."
</p><p align=left>Yes, someone wants us to believe that story, I thought to
myself--someone who hadn't taken into account a Sensate's
sensitive nose.  On the giant's skin, beneath the stink of cheap
whiskey, lurked the more subtle fragrance of Phlegistol: an
ultrahigh-grade fuel oil, said to be mined by gray dwarves in the
caverns of Carceri.  Nobles in The Lady's Ward liked to burn
Phlegistol to heat water for baths; they claimed it burned
cleaner than coal and very very hot.
</p><p align=left>"Sure is a big basher," I said again and whacked the corpse's
side heartily.  A load of liquid in the giant's gut sloshed
loudly in response to my blow; and I had no doubts what that
liquid was.  Our fire-loving enemies had somehow killed this
giant and used the slit in his throat to top him full of
flammable oil.  Afterward, they had soaked him in a few gallons
of whiskey to hide the Phlegistol smell.  Now the corpse was an
eighteen-foot-long bomb, left in an alley for unsuspecting
Collectors who'd deliver it straight to the Mortuary.
</p><p align=left>I wondered how the arsonists intended to set this off.  A
single fire-arrow would do the trick.  You'd want to shoot from a
long distance away, but the giant was a huge target.  A hit
anywhere should be good enough to touch off the payload--whiskey
fumes were flammable enough, but the Phlegistol was positively
explosive.  For maximum effect, the enemy would probably wait
till most of the body was inside the doors of the Mortuary; then
boom.
</p><p align=left>As quickly as I could while maintaining my drunken act, I
waved cheery-bye to the Collectors and wobbled my way back to the
tenement.  Brother Kiripao was waiting inside the door.  "The
corpse is a bomb," I said in a low voice, as I slipped back into
my jacket.
</p><p align=left>"A large bomb?" he asked.
</p><p align=left>"I'd guess more than a ton of Phlegistol."
</p><p align=left>He glanced at the giant, now being heaved off the carts and
hauled slowly up the Mortuary's front steps.  "We must leave this
building," he said.  "It cannot withstand a sizable explosion at
such close range."
</p><p align=left>"Then you get around to the rear of the dome," I told him,
"and keep an eye on people escaping that way.  I'll warn the
others."
</p><p align=left>He nodded in agreement and dashed out at once.  Three seconds
later, it occurred to me that he really didn't know what to look
for--only a few of us had the proper dark about the githyanki and
githzerai thieves.  I should have been the one to watch the back,
and let Brother Kiripao clear the building; but something inside
of me wanted to save Yasmin personally.
</p><p align=left>The moment I finished putting on my jacket, I ran for the
stairs.  They squealed and wavered under my feet, but I kept my
balance and made my way upward as fast as possible.  Oonah was
looking over the stair railing at the fourth floor level, and
called down to me, "What's going on?  I saw you in the street."
</p><p align=left>"The giant's filled with Phlegistol," I gasped, panting from
running up the steps.  "If it goes boom, this building will too."
</p><p align=left>"Damned right it will," she nodded.  "I've seen Phlegistol
explosions before.  Gray dwarves love the stuff-- they fill up
wine bottles, jam in cloth fuses, and toss them at people they
don't like.  Good way to burn a whole sodding village."
</p><p align=left>"You and Wheezle clear out of here," I told her.  "I'll get
the others."
</p><p align=left>"Just shout," she said.  "They'll hear you."
</p><p align=left>"So will the enemy," I replied.  "Best not give ourselves
away."  And I hurried up the stairs again before she could argue.
</p><p align=left>My heart was pounding loudly in my ears when I finally reached
the top.  Of course, Hezekiah had heard the racket of the
creaking stairs and come to investigate.  "We have..." I wheezed,
"...we have...to get out.  Bomb."
</p><p align=left>"What's a bomb?" he asked, perky as ever.
</p><p align=left>Piking stupid Prime-worlders!  To them, the height of military
ingenuity was sharpening both edges of your sword.
</p><p align=left>"What's this about a bomb?" Yasmin said, coming out of the
surveillance room.
</p><p align=left>"The giant..." I told her.  "Phlegistol...we have to..."
</p><p align=left>"All right, hold on."
</p><p align=left>She ran back into the room, while I leaned against the
bannister and tried to catch my breath.  Hezekiah gave my arm a
genial pat, then said, "I'd better collect our gear."  He too ran
off, his boots hitting the floor heavily enough to send tremors
through the staircase.  I lowered myself to the steps and sat for
a moment, listening to my heart thud.  Winded as I was, perhaps I
should start downstairs immediately; the others were in better
shape, and would easily catch up.  However, my pride wouldn't let
me run off--I had to wait for Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>And Hezekiah too, of course.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin hurried out of the room, her knapsack on her back and
the portrait I'd drawn rolled up in one hand.  "Be careful when
you roll up a charcoal sketch," I told her.  "They smudge
easily."
</p><p align=left>"Pike it, berk," she snapped, but her face wore the ghost of a
smile.  "They've already got the giant halfway through the
doorway.  Perfect time to hit it with a burning--"
</p><p align=left>A brilliant burst of light flashed through the window,
followed a split-second later by a thunderous roar.  The tenement
rocked back sharply, sections of its roof blowing away like loose
paper; then the full force of the explosion struck home, smashing
the front wall of the building with fists of naked fire.  Yasmin
was thrown off her feet by the blast of hot air, and tossed
sprawling across my lap where I sat on the stairs.
</p><p align=left>As for the stairs...with a single shriek of rusty nails, the
staircase supports ripped out of the surrounding wood.  Then we
were falling free.
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="4"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
4. THREE DUSTY KILLERS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Seven storeys with two flights of stairs per storey-- once we
started falling, we didn't stop.  Bam, our steps smashed down on
the steps beneath and banged them free of their supports; then
both flights were falling together, down to the next floor, and
so on.  One floor after another, every jarring crash followed by
another one-storey drop, like a house of cards collapsing in on
itself.  Bam, bam, bam, with flaming boards falling around us and
sparks sputtering through the air.  During the split-second we
stopped at each floor, plaster from that floor's ceiling smacked
down on us in brittle sheets.  Then the next flight of stairs
would give way, and another fall, another jolt, another shower of
plaster breaking over my head and Yasmin's back.
</p><p align=left>Each time we landed, Yasmin gave a painful whoof of breath.
She had fallen with her stomach across my lap, and each impact
drove my knees into her diaphragm.  Halfway down, her body
slumped limply, stunned by having the wind knocked out of her
over and over again.  Desperately, I held onto her with all my
strength so she wouldn't tumble away-- riding the stairs like a
bucking bronco might bruise us black and blue, but getting thrown
off into a burning building would put us in the dead-book for
sure.
</p><p align=left>At long last we stopped, perched high atop a stack of piled-up
stairflights.  That put us almost even with the first floor above
ground level; so with scant seconds before the tenement came
thundering down around our ears, I heaved up Yasmin's body and
ran straight for the front of the building.  There was a hole in
the wall there, a ragged breach where the explosion had punched
out a sweep of rotten boards.  The boards now littered the floor,
too punky to burn, even in the Phlegistol heat; but the sides of
the hole had caught and now blazed hungrily with bright fire,
sucking in a gale of fresh air from outside.  I didn't stop.  I
simply cradled Yasmin to my chest, and jumped straight through
the opening.
</p><p align=left>The distance to the ground was only ten feet--a painful drop
but scarcely a killer, provided you land properly.  Once in the
air, however, I realized there was no way to land properly with a
full-grown woman in my arms.  Protecting her head from the
cobblestones was the best I could do...and then we struck down on
something much softer than expected, softer than pavement, softer
than burning wood.
</p><p align=left>It was a hand: the giant's left hand, blown clean off at the
wrist.  We landed as gently as nestling birds, snuggling down
into the palm.  Now, however, the giant's skin was not its
original sulfur yellow, but an ugly charred black; and the
whiskey smell had been replaced by the odor of roast pork.
</p><p align=left>Dappling the pavement around us were other hunks of smoking
flesh: some from the giant, some from the Collectors who had been
carrying the corpse into the Mortuary.  Surprisingly, this
carnage was easier for me to stomach than the massacre at the
City Courts--except for the giant's hand, nothing was intact
enough to recognize as fleshly remains.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin drew in a ragged breath and rolled back against the
giant's scorched thumb.  Somehow she had managed to keep hold of
my charcoal sketch through everything, though the paper had
crumpled where it was squeezed in her fist.  She looked down at
it and blearily tried to straighten the creases.
</p><p align=left>"Never mind that," I said.  "How are you?"
</p><p align=left>"Alive, by the grace of Entropy," she groaned.  "Did the
others..."
</p><p align=left>I turned to look at the tenement.  It chose that moment to
cave in on itself, the whole structure slumping neatly downward
into a smoking pile.  The buildings on either side, also battered
by the explosion, leaned inward to fill the gap left by the
collapse.  One by one, they all toppled onto the smoldering heap.
</p><p align=left>The whole process took less than five seconds.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin..." Yasmin whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Oonah and Wheezle had time to get out," I answered, without
looking at her.  "But poor Hezekiah was still on the seventh--"
</p><p align=left>"Hi," said Hezekiah, from behind our backs.  "What are you
doing in that hand?"
</p><p align=left>Grimacing, I turned to face him.  "You teleported out?"
</p><p align=left>"Sure.  If you two had just waited, I would have brought you
with me."
</p><p align=left>"Too easy," I muttered.  "We preferred taking the more
exciting way down."
</p><p align=left>"You Sensates!"  He laughed and punched me playfully in the
shoulder.  "Come on and I'll take you to the others."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin tried to knife him in the back, but I stopped her in
time.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Oonah and Wheezle had taken refuge behind one of the
Mortuary's most solid outbuildings: the marble sanctuary that
housed Sigil's Monument of the Ages.  Factol Skall of the Dustmen
had created this monument to peel a little more gold from the
pockets of rich leatherheads, letting them pay for the privilege
of inscribing their names on a great stone obelisk that would
"preserve their fame for all time".  Looking through an archway
into the monument building, I saw that the obelisk had been
toppled by the shockwave of the explosion; it now lay on the
ground, broken into three pieces.
</p><p align=left>"My condolences on all this mess," I said to Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>"Why?" he asked, his small gnome eyes blinking in surprise.
"To a Dustman, this is a day of high celebration.  So many souls
ushered into the Ultimate Peace."
</p><p align=left>"It's a thrill for the Doomguard too," Yasmin assured him.
"Too noisy and presumptuous, of course--we'd rather let things
fall down on their own.  Still..."  She looked around at the
fractured monument, the collapsed row of tenements, the scattered
gobbets of baked flesh.  "It was a really good boom."
</p><p align=left>I too scanned the destruction and devastation.  A tragic waste
of life...but as a Sensate, I rather enjoyed the boom myself.
Who says opposing factions have nothing in common?
</p><p align=left>"If we've finished applauding this wholesale slaughter," Oonah
said angrily, "can we remember we have a job to do?"
</p><p align=left>"Of course, honored Guvner," Wheezle replied, kowtowing
politely.  "What would you like to do?"
</p><p align=left>"Did anyone see how the sodding berks set off the bomb?" Oonah
asked.
</p><p align=left>"The easiest method would be a flame arrow shot from a
distance," I told her, "although these people like fireballs so
much, maybe they used one of those wands from the court rotunda."
</p><p align=left>"Some of us should search for the shooter," Oonah said.  "Look
anyplace that had a clear line of fire on the Mortuary's front
door.  Wheezle?  Hezekiah?"
</p><p align=left>Wheezle kowtowed.  Hezekiah tried to kowtow too, but just
looked ridiculous.  Together, the two of them trotted off toward
the front of the building.  I was glad to see that even Hezekiah
had the sense to stay close to cover and keep his eyes open.
</p><p align=left>"The rest of us should head for the back door," Oonah
continued, "and hope the enemy hasn't already escaped."
</p><p align=left>"I sent Brother Kiripao to watch the back before the
explosion," I said.
</p><p align=left>"Good," she nodded.  "Let's find him."
</p><p align=left>We set a quick pace around the perimeter of the Mortuary,
keeping to the protection of the outbuildings as much as
possible.  Yasmin matched stride beside me; she still held the
crumpled sketch in her hand.  After a while, she asked in a low
voice, "Why are we so interested in the rear entrance?  I thought
we just had to watch for an attack, then trail the culprits."
</p><p align=left>"The attack on the courts was actually a diversion to cover a
theft," I told her.  "The factols suspect that all the attacks
were diversions; so we're going to check the rear entrance to see
if thieves come running out."
</p><p align=left>"How will you tell the thieves from everyone else?" she asked.
"At least three funerals have gone into the building already this
morning.  If those people hear a big sodding explosion at the
front door, they're all going to run out the back."
</p><p align=left>"We'll just have to keep our eyes open and hope for the best,"
Oonah answered, throwing a pointed glance at me.  She obviously
wanted to keep the githyanki and githzerai a secret, though I
couldn't see why.  Maybe Guvners just liked knowing things other
people didn't.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Kiripao had positioned himself at the corner of the last
outbuilding.  He bowed to us as we came up beside him, and
whispered, "A great many people have run from the door, but no
one out of the ordinary.  I have taken the liberty of casting a
spell to detect the presence of magic; the escapees possess
nothing notable."
</p><p align=left>I wondered what kind of magical radiations he perceived from
the rest of us.  Oonah's staff must put out a powerful shine, and
Yasmin's dragon leotard would give off its own healthy glow.  As
for me, I had the lantern-stone in my pocket, not to mention my
father's rapier; considering the amount of money he paid to have
it enchanted, the sword must blaze as bright as a phoenix's
fundament.
</p><p align=left>"Cavendish!" Oonah growled in my ear.  "Stop wool-gathering.
Check for familiar faces in the crowd."
</p><p align=left>I looked around the corner of the building, and saw about
twenty people milling in the street.  Most had been attending
funerals inside the Mortuary, so they wore clothes of whatever
color their cultures associated with grief: black and white
predominated, with the occasional dash of blood red.  In among
the mourners, a handful of gray-robed Dustmen tried to calm the
crowd.  "There's no cause for alarm," I heard one call, as smoke
from burning tenements drifted over the Mortuary dome.
</p><p align=left>The people in the street were the usual mix of races you find
in Sigil: humans, bariaur, tieflings, even one githzerai.  The
githzerai was a woman, and short for her species--nothing like
the male I had seen in the Courts.
</p><p align=left>"Ahh," Brother Kiripao murmured.  "This is more interesting."
He pointed to a group of five figures, just emerging from the
Mortuary.  All of them wore Dustman robes, with the hoods pulled
down over their faces.
</p><p align=left>"Magic?" I whispered.  Kiripao nodded.
</p><p align=left>"Five of them, four of us," Oonah muttered beside my shoulder.
"If they split up, we're in trouble.  Still...I'll follow the
first to leave, Kiripao the second, and Yasmin the third.  If the
last two go in different directions, Cavendish, use your best
judgment."
</p><p align=left>The front two paused just before they reached the bottom of
the Mortuary steps; warily, they looked both directions along the
street.  In that moment, I could see their faces clearly, despite
the shadows cast by their hoods--they were the same githyanki and
githzerai who peeled Oonah's office.
</p><p align=left>"That's them," I murmured.  As I spoke, the two thieves
descended the last step into the street and hurried off in the
opposite direction from us.
</p><p align=left>"Come along, Brother Cipher," Oonah said to Kiripao.  Without
waiting, she slipped around the edge of the building and into the
street, quickly crossing to the closest clump of mourners and
blending in with them.  Kiripao trailed behind Oonah, while
Yasmin and I kept our eyes on the three figures still on the
steps.
</p><p align=left>The shrouded trio stood where they were for several seconds,
watching the githyanki and githzerai head up the street; then
they descended to ground level, straight into the crowd.  There
was something odd about the way they walked, the way they stayed
inside the shadows of the Mortuary dome, the aggressive way they
swung their arms-- like apes, or like...
</p><p align=left>"Eustace," I murmured.
</p><p align=left>"What?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"Never mind," I said.  "You're a priestess, right?"
</p><p align=left>"My official title is Handmaid of Entropy."
</p><p align=left>"You can explain what that means another time," I told her.
"Do you have any power over the undead?"
</p><p align=left>"Entropy isn't some god who protects you from ghoulies and
ghosties," she replied indignantly.  "It's the supreme force of
nature.  We like to say we're the opposite side of the coin from
druids--they hug trees, we chop the sodding things down as a
sacrament."
</p><p align=left>"Both no doubt annoy the trees," I told her, "but at the
moment, I'm more interested in a cleric who can command wights
to...pike it, there they go."
</p><p align=left>The three hooded figures had already entered the crowd.  Now
they threw off their robes, and hissed pure hatred at the
mourners around them.  As I suspected, the three were barrow
wights like our delivery boy Eustace, animated corpses with
razor-sharp claws in place of fingernails; and their job must be
to cover the escape of the other two thieves.
</p><p align=left>People screamed at the sight of the undead monsters, then
stumbled backward in a rush.  One woman tripped over someone
behind her, and fell shrieking to the cobblestones.  Immediately,
the closest wight leapt to the attack, grabbing her wrist with
one hand and raking the claws of its other hand down her arm.
Where the creature's claws made contact, the woman's flesh
withered away, her muscles dissolving to threads as the skin
shrank tight to the bone.  The wight hissed once in triumph, then
let her wrist go; the arm clattered useless to the pavement,
reduced to a skeletal husk.
</p><p align=left>"What are you doing?" shouted a nearby Dustman to the wight.
The man was in his forties, with red tattoo spirals inscribed on
both cheeks.  He walked straight up to the creature and stood in
front of it, hands on his hips...like an outraged schoolmaster
who's caught a student cheating.  "Get back inside at once," the
Dustman said.  "This behavior is intolerable."
</p><p align=left>The wight cocked its head to one side, and regarded the
Dustman with intense interest.  Then its hand shot forward, claws
outstretched; the nails stabbed through the Dustman's clothes
like gauze and buried themselves deep in his chest, five soul-
stealing daggers.  The Dustman gasped softly.  Something creaked
inside of him, a long agonized noise like someone bending a stick
slowly to the breaking point.  One rib cracked, then another,
then another, snapping so fiercely the ends of the bones pierced
outward through the man's chest and protruded whitely from his
robes.
</p><p align=left>Blood gushed in fountains, spattering the wight's face.  It
simply licked its lips and waited, waited till its life-draining
grip had shriveled the man's chest to a pulp bristling with
broken bones.  Then it tossed the Dustman's corpse against the
Mortuary wall, where it fell to the ground, rattling.
</p><p align=left>"That's impossible!" Yasmin whispered.
</p><p align=left>"How long have you lived in Sigil?" I whispered back.
"Everything's possible here."
</p><p align=left>"But the Dustmen have a pact with the undead--the Dead Truce.
Undead creatures like that wight simply won't attack a Dustman
unless the Dustman attacks first."
</p><p align=left>"I know all about the Dead Truce," I told her, "but those
wights don't."
</p><p align=left>"Someone is playing hob with the natural order," she said, and
this time she wasn't whispering.  "Someone is trying to
disrupt..."
</p><p align=left>The rest of the sentence was drowned out by the noise of
Yasmin shucking off her backpack and drawing her sword.
</p><p align=left>"I hope that sword is either magic or silver," I said to her.
"You can't hurt wights with just a normal..."
</p><p align=left>But I didn't finish my sentence either, because Yasmin had
already charged into the fray.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>For half a second, I hesitated--after all, our instructions
had been to watch the enemy and refrain from direct involvement.
However, I couldn't let Yasmin face three wights on her own; and
even if Yasmin hadn't been there, it was high time for me to
start saving lives.  Much as I tried to put it out of my mind, I
had allowed the Collectors to carry the exploding giant to their
doom, because my orders told me to hold back.  My father would
have roared, "Pike the orders, people are dying!"
</p><p align=left>Whipping my rapier out of its sheath, I raced after Yasmin.  A
few mourners were already running in our direction, but they had
enough sense to get out of our way; the rest of the crowd was
shocked frozen with terror, unable to move as each of the wights
chose a new victim to drain.  All three victims were Dustmen, and
all three Dustmen simply stared in disbelief as their hearts were
ripped from their chests.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin took the nearest wight in the back, a furious thrust
that pierced straight through the monster's spine, out the front
of its ribcage, and halfway into the Dustman it held in its
claws.  The wight turned its head to look at Yasmin and hissed,
its breath reeking of humid decay.  I was close enough to smell
the stench; I was also close enough to jam the tip of my rapier
into that open mouth, up through the palate, and into its brain.
Thanks to the sword's enchantments, the blade punched straight
through the wight's skull, scattering gray matter and bone
fragments onto the hapless Dustman in the monster's grip.
</p><p align=left>The Dustman didn't care.  If he hadn't been dead already,
getting impaled on Yasmin's sword had finished the job.
</p><p align=left>Our arrival snapped the remaining mourners out of their
stupors.  Howling with fear, they scattered; one little halfling
even ran back into the Mortuary, certainly not the place I'd run
for protection.  By the time Yasmin and I dislodged our blades
from the now-dead wight, we were alone in the street with the two
remaining monsters.
</p><p align=left>"One on one?" I asked her.  "Or shall we gang up on the
closest of these berks?"
</p><p align=left>"I'll take the closest," she replied.  "You keep the other off
my back."
</p><p align=left>"Your wish is my command."
</p><p align=left>Giving Yasmin's wight a wide berth, I sped around to face the
other one.  Once upon a time, this particular wight had been a
woman, but that had been years ago.  Now her face was ravaged
with tomb rot, her skin flaking away to reveal the ligaments
beneath.
</p><p align=left>"Hello," I said to the monster.  "Would you be available to
model the next time I teach a figure drawing class?  Students
always have such a hard time with the anatomy of the face, and
here you are, already dissected.  You're a walking anatomy text
book, my dear."
</p><p align=left>The monster hissed and took a tentative swipe at me.  I
flicked my sword at her hand, just enough to make a small cut on
her wrist.  No blood dribbled out: nothing but a trickle of
reddish dust.
</p><p align=left>"Some people think the rapier is an ineffectual little
weapon," I told the wight, "but they're only familiar with the
blades used in competition fencing."  I stepped in just long
enough for a slash that cut several exposed ligaments on her left
cheek, then backed quickly away.  "A competition rapier is only a
thrusting weapon," I explained, "but as you can see, a real
rapier has two perfectly good cutting edges.  Are you following
all this?"
</p><p align=left>By the look of it, the wight was only interested in finding a
way past my guard.  She kept lunging, hissing and missing, as I
swirled the blade in a continuously circling parry.  The little
nicks I gave her did no serious damage, but they kept her at bay;
and second by second, her rage grew.
</p><p align=left>"I don't suppose you'd like to tell me why you broke the Dead
Truce," I asked the wight.  "Whom you work for, what their plan
is, that sort of thing?"
</p><p align=left>She hissed.
</p><p align=left>"So the truth is, you can't talk, right?"
</p><p align=left>She hissed again.
</p><p align=left>"That would be a yes," I said to myself.  Not being an expert
on the undead, I had no idea whether your average wight was
capable of speech; then again, these were obviously not average
wights.  These were creatures who should be examined by
knowledgeable authorities.
</p><p align=left>Without taking my eyes off the wight in front of me, I called
to Yasmin, "Keep dancing with your playmate out here.  I need to
consult a professional."  Then, with a flurry of sword strokes, I
drove my wight back toward the Mortuary steps.  (The monster
really was a ham-handed fighter...but then, when you can wither
opponents with one swipe of your claws, you don't have much
incentive to acquire finesse.)
</p><p align=left>Up the stairs we went, wight hissing, my blade slashing.  The
huge iron-plated door gaped wide open, and we went inside, the
wight still backing away from my attack and spitting with fury.
</p><p align=left>I had attended my share of funerals in the Mortuary, but had
always used the main entrance.  This back area was unfamiliar to
me, a curving stone corridor with numerous doors--some open, some
closed, and a big one leading to the front of the building, blown
off its hinges by the exploding Phlegistol.  With the exception
of the wight's continuing hisses, the place was as quiet as a
tomb.  Admittedly, that shouldn't have been a surprise.
</p><p align=left>"Hello!" I shouted.  "Anybody home?"
</p><p align=left>My voice echoed off the stone walls; the sound seemed to last
forever.  The wight made a half-hearted charge toward me, but
backed away as the edge of my rapier sliced a gash across her
collarbone.  Accepting the inevitable, she began to back down the
corridor that led to the front of the building.  I could smell
things burning ahead of us, and slowed my pace...not from fear of
the fire, but from concern about the smoke.  Wights are dead, so
they don't have to breathe; if I started to get dizzy from smoke
inhalation, the monster in front of me would gain a distinct
advantage.
</p><p align=left>"I'd really love to talk to a Dustman," I yelled, the Mortuary
dome echoing dustman, dustman, dustman.  "I have a renegade wight
here that a Dustman should examine.  It broke the Dead Truce.
Someone should have a look at it."
</p><p align=left>"A renegade wight, you say?"
</p><p align=left>At the far end of the corridor a gaunt figure appeared,
backlit by the flicker of fires ravaging the front part of the
Mortuary.  For a moment the figure looked like some kind of
undead thing itself, a corpse dressed in gray robes; but then my
eyes adjusted to the light and recognized the reclusive Factol
Skall of the Dustmen.
</p><p align=left>The wight was sandwiched between Skall and myself.  She turned
at the sound of his voice, and studied him.
</p><p align=left>"Be careful, your honor," I said to Skall.  "She killed
several Dustmen out in the street.  I saw her."
</p><p align=left>"She attacked first?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes, your honor.  Without provocation."
</p><p align=left>"I find that hard to believe."
</p><p align=left>The wight was looking back and forth between Skall and me,
hissing more violently than ever.  Her eyes burned as bright as
the flames at the factol's back.  Suddenly, she feinted a lunge
at me, then hurtled toward Skall, claws poised for the kill.  I
raced after her, sprinting as fast as I could while preparing to
slash off her head.  Much as I had hoped the Dustmen could
interrogate her, saving the factol's life had higher priority.
</p><p align=left>The wight sped toward Skall.  I sped after her.  Skall stood
calmly as the two of us descended upon him; and at the last
moment, he simply held up his hands and said, "Stop."
</p><p align=left>My legs froze, my brain froze...even my arm, swinging down
with the decapitating stroke, simply stopped dead in the air as
if trapped in ice.  The wight, however, seemed immune to whatever
magic Skall used to paralyze me.  She closed the remaining gap
and seized Skall's arms with the ferocity of a rabid dog that has
finally found someone to attack.  Hissing gleefully, she dug her
claws into his wrists and squeezed.
</p><p align=left>For several seconds, Skall didn't move a muscle.  Then,
slowly, he twisted his arms in the wight's grasp, so that he
could grasp her wrists as tightly as she held his.  The two stood
there clutching each other, the crimson light of the wight's eyes
flaring brighter and brighter in the dark corridor.
</p><p align=left>The embrace lasted almost a full minute, while I stood by
helpless, unable to move.  Slowly, the hatred on the wight's face
changed to puzzlement, and she tried to pull away; but Skall held
on easily, without a hint of strain.  The fire in the wight's
eyes continued to grow, casting two blurs of scarlet on the gray
stone wall.  At the last moment, she turned over her shoulder to
look at me, her rotten face grimacing with fear and confusion.
Then her entire body burst like a soap bubble, showering the
corridor with a spray of cloying red dust.
</p><p align=left>"Remarkable," said Skall.  His robes were crimson with the
dust, his face powdered to the color of blood.  With a sudden
surge, strength returned to my limbs and I could lower my sword
arm.  "Remarkable," Skall said again.  Turning his back on me, he
walked off into the burning Mortuary, completely ignoring the
flames.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Where have you been?" Yasmin asked.  She had just retrieved
her backpack, and was once more holding my charcoal sketch in her
hand.  The wight she'd been fighting lay chopped into pieces on
the pavement.
</p><p align=left>"I've just had a chat with Factol Skall," I told her.
</p><p align=left>"Did you learn anything?"
</p><p align=left>"That I never want another chat with Factol Skall."  I poked
the pieces of Yasmin's wight with my toe.  Red dust spilled from
the sword wounds.  "Is that dust typical when you kill wights?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't know," Yasmin answered.  "I've never fought a wight
before."
</p><p align=left>"Maybe one of our colleagues has."  I looked down the street
in the direction Oonah and Kiripao had pursued the thieves.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin followed my gaze.  "Should we go after them?" she
asked.
</p><p align=left>"You go ahead," I told her.  "If our friends chase the enemy
into the Hive, you'll have a hard time picking up their
trail...but then, Oonah's the sort to leave marks as she goes.
Deliberate scuffs in the dirt, arrows drawn on the pavement, that
kind of thing."
</p><p align=left>"What are you going to do?"
</p><p align=left>"I want to examine these wights more closely.  They've piqued
my curiosity."
</p><p align=left>"All right."  She looked at me keenly for a few moments, as if
trying to put some emotion into words.  Finally, she simply said,
"Watch your back, Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>Before I could reply, she was running down the street, a lean
figure in tight black dragon-skin.  I tried to burn the image
into my memory; it was something I'd want to sketch later on, and
who cared if it didn't earn money.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Dust.
</p><p align=left>Red dust pouring out of the wounds instead of blood.  And
underneath the robes that the wights wore as disguise, their
ragged clothes were clogged thick with another kind of dust, a
fine silt that reminded me of sculptor's clay.
</p><p align=left>I stroked the silt, then licked a bit off my finger.  It had a
soft nippy taste, like weak curry powder.  Maybe these wights had
a hide-out in a spice warehouse.  However, the dust wasn't yellow
like curry--on first glimpse, it had a light tan color, but on
closer inspection I saw it was actually a mix of white and dark
brown particles.
</p><p align=left>Red dust, white dust, brown dust...what I needed was a dwarf,
a dwarf of a fanatical dwarvish bent: the kind who studies soil
the way a lecher studies women.  We had a few such dwarves in the
Sensates, forever bringing in new minerals for everyone to sniff,
lick, and eventually chew.  It was only by the grace of healing
spells that I still had a full set of teeth; at that moment,
however, I would have welcomed one of those rock-kisser dwarves
with open arms, if he could identify all these different types of
dust.
</p><p align=left>Without such knowledge, I could only take samples of the dust
and hope to get them identified later.  For the brown and white
dust, I ripped away a scrap of wight's clothing that was heavily
imbued with the stuff; for the red dust, I tore off a page from
my sketchbook and held it under one of the wight's wounds,
catching the sifting dribble that took the place of blood.
Carefully, I folded both samples and tucked them into my pocket.
</p><p align=left>As I straightened from examining the last wight, Hezekiah
galloped around the corner of the Mortuary.  "Britlin," he
shouted, "come on, hurry!"
</p><p align=left>"What is it?"
</p><p align=left>"Wheezle and me," he gasped.  "We've cornered the shooter."
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="5"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
5. THREE SWINGS OF THE GATE
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>I followed Hezekiah, and as we jogged he explained what had
happened.  He and Wheezle had scoured the area around the front
of the Mortuary in search of whoever set off the explosion--not
an easy task, given that most of the buildings had burst into
flames.  The boy and the gnome found several hiding places where
someone might have shot a fireball or flame arrow to ignite the
oil-soaked giant; but all those spots had been empty.  With each
passing moment the search for other such locations became more
difficult, as people from nearby houses began to fill the
streets, screaming at the fires and trying to organize bucket
brigades from the closest wells.
</p><p align=left>In the middle of this growing confusion, Hezekiah had spotted
a familiar face in the crowd.  Leaning casually against a half-
demolished stone wall stood one of the three men who participated
in the fireball attack on the City Courts--the heavily-bearded
basher with his hair bleached white.  Tucked into his belt was a
wand Hezekiah immediately recognized: bone-white ivory, speckled
with glitters of red.
</p><p align=left>The man (whom Hezekiah dubbed Bleach-Hair) had stayed for a
few minutes to watch the mob's frantic response to the fire, then
walked away into the Hive.  Hezekiah and Wheezle had followed at
a distance, hampered by the growing crowds who had come to gawk
at the fires.  Once, my teammates actually lost their quarry; but
they tracked him down again by running toward the noise of a
fight in the next street.
</p><p align=left>By lucky chance (lucky for us, anyway), Bleach-Hair had turned
a corner and run smack into the Parade of Dancing Ecstatics, as
it wound its never-ending way through the byways of Sigil.
Hezekiah only knew about them thanks to a brief explanation from
Wheezle; but I was thoroughly familiar with the Ecstatics, having
danced with them for three solid days several years earlier.
</p><p align=left>The Ecstatic Parade has continued without stop for more than
four centuries, a drunkenly riotous assemblage of anyone who
wants to join, prancing through the city streets according to the
whims of whoever happens to be at the head of the line.  A short
distance behind the leader is a group of ten people called The
Carriers of the Cow.  They do not actually carry a cow; all they
have is an empty wooden platform which is, I might add from
experience, bristling with sodding splinters.  Perhaps when the
parade started so many years ago, the platform actually sported a
cow, whether a living animal or a statue.  Sometime over the
centuries, however, the cow disappeared, and now only the
platform remains.
</p><p align=left>Not even the Guvners remember what the parade is intended to
celebrate, nor how it all started.  The people who join it are
simply people who want to dance and bub wine till they pass out
in the street.  Some dancers bring wine of their own to get
themselves started, but that's seldom necessary; it's considered
enormously good luck to donate drink to the parade if it passes
you.  When I danced in the parade elderly grandmothers begged me
to take their hooch, in the belief that giving such a gift would
help their arthritis.  Who knows?  Maybe it did.  The women
certainly seemed limber enough as they ran after me with their
homemade moonshine.
</p><p align=left>So Bleach-Hair the fireballer had accidentally run into the
parade, jostling several Carriers of the Cow.  The drunken
revellers had reacted predictably; and after the flailing of many
fists, Bleach-Hair was riding naked on the cow's platform, his
clothes and other equipment tossed into the street and trampled
by dozens of dancing drunks.
</p><p align=left>"I hope you and Wheezle nabbed the firewand," I said to
Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>The boy's answer was yes, but it had been a near thing.  All
of this happened in the slum streets of the Hive...and nothing
but dog dung can lie on the pavement there without someone trying
to steal it.  Eager hands quickly grabbed for Bleach-Hair's
discarded goods; but Wheezle had whipped a little piece of wool
from his pocket, gestured and chanted for a moment, and suddenly
there was a squad of Harmonium guards coming around the corner
with spoiling-for-a-fight looks on their faces.  The cross-
traders trying to bob Bleach-Hair's wand had vanished in a trice,
giving Hezekiah free rein to collect what Bleach-Hair had
dropped.
</p><p align=left>"Did you get his clothes too?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Everything," Hezekiah laughed, "we got everything.  And as
soon as I had it in my hands, the guards just melted into the
pavement.  Wheezle's really very good."
</p><p align=left>"Gnomes are renowned as illusionists," I agreed, then urged
Hezekiah to continue his story.
</p><p align=left>The Ecstatics carried Bleach-Hair on the cow's platform for
several blocks before he managed to catch hold of a clothes-line
strung across the street and swing into an open window on the
second floor of a tenement building.  Much cursing ensued; but
when Bleach-Hair came running out the building's front door, he
was carrying some pants he'd stolen from the clothes-line and
wearing most of a bowl of noodles dumped over his head.  He had
dodged the stragglers of the Ecstatic Parade and run down an
alley to put on the pants.  Then Hezekiah and Wheezle followed
him to, of all places, a dirt-crusted tattoo parlor where he had
been ever since.
</p><p align=left>"You think that's the enemy headquarters?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"No," Hezekiah replied, "I think he's getting a tattoo."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>When we reached the parlor, our gnome colleague was nowhere in
sight.  Hezekiah led me to an alleyway which had a clear view of
the shop, but also sufficient shadow to hide our presence.  The
moment we settled down to watch, a voice from thin air said,
"He's still getting his tattoo."
</p><p align=left>My skin crinkled into goosebumps.  "You're invisible, aren't
you, Wheezle?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes, honored Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>I couldn't see it, but I knew he was kowtowing to me.
</p><p align=left>"So," I said, "I assume you've been inside the shop for a peek
at what's going on."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed.  Mr. Bleach-Hair is obtaining a self-portrait on his
right forearm."
</p><p align=left>"How odd."  Tattooing is fashionable with parts of the
populace, inside Sigil and all through the Outer Planes; but I'd
never seen people display tattooed pictures of themselves.  Most
folks preferred arcane symbols, or clan markings, or images
celebrating things they had killed.  Never their own faces.  For
that matter, I seldom saw any kind of face, since it took an
expert tattoo artist to make anything more than a cartoonish
likeness.
</p><p align=left>"Tell me exactly what went on in there," I said to the
invisible Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>"The man, Mr. Bleach-Hair, entered and spoke some words to the
proprietor of the shop.  The proprietor is a drow woman, sir--a
dark elf.  She is probably very good at her trade; elves always
excel at crafts."
</p><p align=left>"I'm aware of that, Wheezle.  Just get on with the story."
</p><p align=left>"Of course, honored Cavendish."  This time, I really did catch
the faint swishing sound as Wheezle kowtowed.  "Alas, I could not
get close enough to hear what Mr. Bleach-Hair said to the woman,
since I had not yet cast my invisibility spell.  However, there
seemed to be a great deal of negotiations before the tattooist
got down to business."
</p><p align=left>"That's because we've got his money," Hezekiah put in, holding
up a bundle of clothing with dusty footprints all over it.
</p><p align=left>"In the end," Wheezle continued, "he had to give the woman a
gold ring from his finger, a ring the Ecstatics had overlooked
while stripping him down.  The woman accepted that as payment and
has been working on his arm ever since.  When it became apparent
this would be a lengthy process, Master Hezekiah volunteered to
go back to the Mortuary to find whoever was still there."
</p><p align=left>Since we had the time, I gave the two of them my own report,
telling about Oonah and Kiripao shadowing the two thieves while
Yasmin and I dealt with the wights.  Wheezle became very silent
when I spoke of the undead creatures attacking his fellow
Dustmen; I couldn't tell if he was shocked at wights breaking the
Dead Truce, or grieving over the deaths of his fellows.  Possibly
he was rejoicing that his colleagues had finally reached the
ultimate purity of death--I've never understood the thought
processes of Dustmen.
</p><p align=left>While Wheezle mourned or celebrated, I looked through Bleach-
Hair's discarded belongings.  The clothes were plain yet durable,
of a cut that would attract no special notice in the Hive.  It
didn't surprise me they were coated with dust, the same brown and
white mixture I'd seen on the wights.  Did that mean anything?
Probably, but I couldn't guess what.
</p><p align=left>The objects he carried were of greater interest.  First, of
course, was the firewand.  I decided not to touch it with my bare
hand, on the chance that it was booby-trapped.  In fact, it
seemed easiest to let Hezekiah keep it--perhaps his exalted Uncle
Toby had taught him the care and handling of magic wands.
Meanwhile, I went back to sorting through the rest of Bleach-
Hair's possessions: a dagger with its blade coated in sticky
green resin, no doubt some kind of poison; a platinum chain
necklace that had been broken in the fight with the Ecstatics;
and a stiff piece of card inside his money pouch, showing an ink
drawing of Bleach-Hair himself.
</p><p align=left>"Hmm," I muttered, "this fellow must love his own face."
Seriously so--as soon as he lost the ink drawing, he went to the
tattoo parlor to get a replacement.  He was even willing to part
with his gold ring to pay for the new picture.  To me, this went
beyond any conceivable narcissism; if I'd just lost most of my
jink, I wouldn't immediately barter away my one remaining chunk
of gold on mere vanity.  Bleach-Hair must desperately need his
own portrait for some reason...and that smacked of magic.
</p><p align=left>"All right, you two mages," I said to Hezekiah and Wheezle,
"what kind of spell can only be cast if you're carrying a picture
of yourself?"
</p><p align=left>"An interesting question, sir," Wheezle replied, "but I cannot
provide a helpful answer.  There are many schools of spellcasting
and much variation within schools.  Two people casting the same
spell may use entirely different components, depending on their
personal backgrounds.  Sorcerers from Prime Material worlds tend
to be particularly idiosyncratic."
</p><p align=left>I threw a glance at Hezekiah.  "You've certainly got a point,"
I told Wheezle.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Bleach-Hair left the parlor a few minutes after a nearby clock
struck peak: midday.  Wheezle had been watching the man
invisibly, and had given us plenty of warning before he came out;
therefore, Hezekiah and I were hidden well back in shadows when
Bleach-Hair passed by on the street, gingerly dabbing a yellowish
ointment onto his arm.
</p><p align=left>The tenderness of his new tattoo made it easy for us to follow
him through the teeming streets of the Hive.  Bleach-Hair just
couldn't leave the tattoo alone--constantly staring at it,
brushing it timidly with a finger, and rolling his arm so he
could see how it looked in various kinds of light.  With his
thoughts so preoccupied by his new acquisition, he paid no
attention to the people around him.  We stuck close as he passed
all the sights of the slums: the dingy shops, the whiskey-soaked
bubbers lying unconscious on the sidewalk, the children
pretending to play tag in the streets as an excuse for dodging
around people and picking their pockets.
</p><p align=left>It took almost an hour for Bleach-Hair to weave through the
labyrinth of streets to reach his destination, but I could see
his goal long before we got there: a towering assemblage of glass
vats, arranged in a haphazard corkscrew around a central wooden
framework that rose twenty storeys into the sky.  Each circular
vat measured ten paces in diameter and at least twenty feet high,
filled with murky water and stocked with fish that skimmed
relentlessly past the glass walls.
</p><p align=left>This was Sigil's famed Vertical Sea, a fish farm built long
ago by a wizard named Churtellius: no doubt a master sorcerer in
his day, but now only known for his love of seafood.  He had
painstakingly constructed each of the vats, strengthening the
glass with magic so they could contain the weight of the water;
he had personally supervised the raising of the support frame,
designing the maze of ramps and trestles and catwalks so that the
seemingly random arrangement of vats perfectly counterbalanced
each other; and he had even laid out the complicated schedules
for changing water in the vats, shoveling in fish food, and
harvesting the catch for later sale at the Great Bazaar.  Quite
possibly, Churtellius had created the Sea in a spirit of purest
charity, to ensure that Sigil had an abundant supply of fresh cod
and salmon and scallops...but the chant on the street said
Churtellius was just another barmy spellchucker who'd do anything
to lock down a dependable supply of kippers.
</p><p align=left>Bleach-Hair went straight to the base of the tower, spoke
briefly to the guards who watched the entrance ramp, then began
making his way up the tall corkscrew structure.  "Stay with him,
Wheezle," I whispered, though I had no idea if our friend gnome
was within earshot.  Quite possibly, he was already dogging
Bleach-Hair's footsteps while Hezekiah and I lingered in the
shadows of nearby buildings.
</p><p align=left>"Should we follow too?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"We're only here to watch," I replied.  "If we see evidence
this really is enemy headquarters, we report back to Lady Erin
and let her give these berks the rope.  I for one am not spoiling
to face a bunch of bashers with firewands."
</p><p align=left>"Have you noticed," the boy said, "when you get excited, you
start to use words like berk and basher, the same as other folks
in Sigil?"
</p><p align=left>"Pike it, Clueless," I told him.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah grinned from ear to ear.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Leaving the boy on watch near the base of the tower, I spent a
few minutes roaming the neighborhood in search of a better view
of the Vertical Sea.  I found it at last in a tenement building
across from the tower, much like the one we had used to observe
the Mortuary, but with stairs leading up to the roof.  Like most
roofs in the Hive, it had a pathetically unproductive vegetable
garden, several small chicken coops owned by various tenants of
the building, and a crusty coat of bird droppings.  I walked
carefully across the guano, marking what an interesting squishy
sound it made.
</p><p align=left>The smell was interesting too.
</p><p align=left>Crouching behind a chicken coop, I stared across the street
toward the Vertical Sea.  The tower was busy with people tending
the vats--workers standing on catwalks above the water, netting
up fish and dumping them into wheelbarrows, then trundling their
loads down the ramps.  Bleach-Hair pushed against the downward
flow of wheelbarrows and continued to climb slowly.  Since the
last time I looked, he'd been joined by two familiar men: the
other fireballers from the City Courts.  Both of the newcomers
held firewands in their hands.
</p><p align=left>Where were the three of them going?  I scanned up the tower
looking for anything out of place...and there, just below the
level of my rooftop, was Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>Without the diligently developed eyes of a Sensate, I might
not have recognized her.  She wore drab work clothes now, and had
smudged her face with soot.  Nevertheless, her bony arm crests
were clearly visible, and she still carried that sodding charcoal
sketch I had drawn.  In fact, she made a show of unrolling it
from time to time, glancing at it, then rolling it up again, as
if it was a scroll of instructions she was supposed to follow.
The other fish-workers obviously accepted her pretense--they
moved to and fro past her without a second glance.
</p><p align=left>Once I had recognized Yasmin, it was easy to pick out Oonah
and Kiripao close by her side.  Oonah still had her staff and
Brother Cipher his air of serene lethality, but they too were
disguised as workers, dawdling about with an empty wheelbarrow.
I could only conclude the githyanki and githzerai had led my
teammates to the Vertical Sea...and sure enough, as I looked
farther up the tower, I saw the two thieves ambling along a ramp
almost level with my rooftop.
</p><p align=left>They still wore their Dustmen robes, with hoods pulled down
low.  The clothes attracted attention from the regular workers,
but probably not as much as the sight of a githyanki and
githzerai walking amiably side by side.  I watched as the two
stepped off their ramp and onto a walkway over a vat of dogfish:
scaled-down sharks averaging three feet long, with hungry looks
in their eyes as they prowled behind the glass walls of their
home.
</p><p align=left>I could see no immediate reason why the thieves would be
strolling along a dead-end catwalk over a vat of fish; but as I
strained my eyes, I saw that the struts supporting the next vat
above their heads formed a sort of archway...and the arch was
glowing.
</p><p align=left>"Well, I'll be piked," I whispered.  "It's a portal."
</p><p align=left>Not that I should have been surprised to see a gateway to
another plane halfway up the Vertical Sea.  Throughout the
multiverse, Sigil is known as the City of Doors; the place
probably has more portals than rats, and Sigil has a lot of rats.
Walk down any street, and you're likely to see a portal lurking
somewhere--in the door to a bakery, along the covered cloisters
of a temple, or even in the angle made by a ladder leaning up
against a wall.  Any sort of arch, no matter how temporary, can
suddenly sprout a portal...and who knows if the portal leads to
the blissful meadows of Elysium or the 500th level of the Abyss?
</p><p align=left>Of course, most portals are temperamental things; they refuse
to work unless you're carrying the right "key".  Suppose, for
example, there's a portal anchored in the door of your
neighborhood greengrocer: ninety-nine times out of a hundred, you
could walk through and simply end up staring at the shop's supply
of lettuce.  However, if you happened to carry the particular
class of object that activated the portal--a silver goblet, a
triangular scrap of cloth, a rope with knots at both ends--the
portal would magically wink open and deposit you somewhere else,
a long way from home.  If you passed through the doorway with a
group of friends, they'd be sucked in too; open portals tend to
be hungry.
</p><p align=left>Sigil's portals, blossoming by the hundred, formed the heart
of the city's economy...especially among the local practitioners
of magic.  Some wizards, for example, worked on diagnosis; they
detected new portals, divined what kind of key would make the
portal open, and predicted where you'd end up if you passed
through.  Other mages specialized in prevention--for a hefty fee,
they'd weave spells around your home to make sure the door into
Great-Aunt Effy's bedroom didn't suddenly become a gateway to the
Elemental Plane of Fire.  A third class of sorcerers devoted
themselves to understanding the whole portal phenomenon: what
created them, why they worked, and how they chose what kind of
objects would serve as keys.
</p><p align=left>That third bunch of sorcerers always went barmy in the end.
There's no rational system to explain portals.  They just do
whatever they want...like anchoring themselves in an arch over a
catwalk, ten storeys up the Vertical Sea.
</p><p align=left>The githyanki and githzerai sauntered along the wooden
walkway, glancing casually around to see if anyone was looking
their direction.  Their gaze brushed past my hiding place, but
didn't stop.  When they were happy the coast was clear, they
simply stepped forward and disappeared.  From my position I
couldn't see what lay beyond the gate in the brief moment it was
active; but a thick sifting of dust puffed out of the opening,
slowly settling toward the catwalk and the water surface below.
</p><p align=left>Moments later, my three teammates came into sight, still
pushing their wheelbarrow as if they were genuine fish farmers.
Sharp-eyed Oonah immediately noticed the dust cloud, still
drifting downward--I could see her point to the dust, then up to
the glow around the archway.  Without hesitation, Kiripao dashed
forward along the catwalk; but when he reached the portal he
passed through it without effect, coming to a stop on the planks
of the walkway a few paces beyond.
</p><p align=left>Typical of a Cipher like Kiripao: galloping full speed ahead,
without an ounce of caution.  Angrily, Oonah and Yasmin stormed
onto the catwalk toward Kiripao, both women scolding him for
taking such a chance...and that was when Bleach-Hair and friends
came up behind them.
</p><p align=left>I had to give Bleach-Hair credit--he must have been a clever
man to recognize Oonah in those dirty work clothes.  On the other
hand, she still carried her silver staff, which Bleach-Hair had
good reason to remember from the rotunda.  Whatever the reason,
he took one look at Her Honor and I could see his lips mouthing
DeVail.  He must have realized that a Guvner lurking on the very
brink of this portal meant big trouble, so he took immediate
action: he seized a firewand from one of his companions and
shouted, "Don't move!"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin and Oonah froze immediately.  Kiripao rushed back
through the inactive portal, showing every intention of trying to
fight the three fireballers by himself; but he had to pass Yasmin
and Oonah first, and Yasmin grabbed him, whispering something
short and sharp.  As quickly as he had begun, the good Brother
stopped and simply turned to face Bleach-Hair.
</p><p align=left>"You would not dare to shoot fire up here," Kiripao said, his
voice loud enough to carry clearly across the street to me.
"This structure is wood and we are far above the ground.  If you
set the tower on fire, you couldn't reach safety before tons of
water crashed down around your head."
</p><p align=left>"You have no idea what I'd dare to do," Bleach-Hair snapped.
"Drop your weapons and get down on your bellies."
</p><p align=left>"Weapons?" Yasmin said innocently, taking a step toward him.
"I don't have any weapons.  All I have is this."  She waved the
rolled-up sketch of herself; but from my vantage point, I could
see the bulge of her longsword, slung behind her back and hidden
by her work clothes.
</p><p align=left>"One more step and I fire," Bleach-Hair told her.  "This ain't
no bluff.  I've been beat up and bobbed and badgered today, and
no tiefling is gonna peel me now.  Got that?"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's jaw tightened; so did the faces of Bleach-Hair's two
companions.  They didn't seem nearly as eager to start shooting
fireballs ten storeys up a wooden tower...but they were obviously
too afraid of Bleach-Hair to interfere.
</p><p align=left>"Come along," Oonah said to Yasmin, taking her by the shoulder
and pulling her back along the catwalk.  "We have to be sensible
here."
</p><p align=left>"The sensible thing is to lie on your bellies," Bleach-Hair
shouted.  "Now!"
</p><p align=left>If only I had a cross-bow, I thought to myself.  Or even a
good-sized stone I could whip at Bleach-Hair's head. I had a
decent chance of hitting him--the street between us was as narrow
as every other street in the hive.  But the rooftop where I
crouched had nothing but the tiniest pebbles...and the pitiful
garden, and the chicken coops...
</p><p align=left>Oh.
</p><p align=left>As my three teammates continued the standoff with Bleach-Hair,
I opened the coop in front of me.  "Nice chicken," I whispered,
"friendly chicken, quiet chicken..."
</p><p align=left>The hen inside glared at me with one furious eye.  The other
eye was missing, gouged out in some long-ago battle with another
chicken or a cat.  I hoped that didn't mean she liked to pick
fights--she was sitting on an egg that would make a fine
distraction when hurled at Bleach-Hair's head.
</p><p align=left>"Under normal circumstances," I told the hen in my most
soothing whisper, "I would never deprive a lady of her offspring.
But this is an emergency, life or death; maybe the fate of the
whole city hangs in the balance.  Just be quiet and let me--"
</p><p align=left>The leatherheaded bird pecked my hand: a good solid peck that
drew a drop of blood.  I bit my lip to avoid crying out, then
snatched the sodding egg before the hen could tag me again.  She
let out a squawk, but only one; no doubt she had long ago
resigned herself to the regular abduction of her children.
</p><p align=left>Bleach-Hair didn't react to the hen's noise: all his attention
was focused on my three teammates.  They were slowly backing away
from him, but showing no sign of surrender.  If I threw the egg,
if I could hit Bleach-Hair in the face from this distance, and if
he didn't immediately fire his wand...then Oonah could attack him
with her staff, and both Kiripao and Yasmin would charge forward.
</p><p align=left>Of course, if everything didn't go perfectly, I'd get them all
killed.
</p><p align=left>Wait, I told myself.  Wait for the right moment.
</p><p align=left>"This is my last warning!" shouted Bleach-Hair.  "Lie down or
burn."
</p><p align=left>"Why don't you speak sense to him?" Oonah called to Bleach-
Hair's companions, as she continued to back away on the catwalk.
</p><p align=left>Bleach-Hair's men looked queasy but said nothing.
</p><p align=left>"I'm counting to three," Bleach-Hair said.  "One."
</p><p align=left>I took a deep breath.
</p><p align=left>"Two."
</p><p align=left>I cocked my arm to hurl the egg.
</p><p align=left>"Thr--"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin threw herself backward.  She must have intended to pull
Oonah and Kiripao with her down into the vat of water, where
they'd be safe from the fireball.  However, her lunge moved her
right under the arch of support struts, the one that glowed with
the light of a portal.  In an instant, Yasmin and my other two
teammates were sucked through the gateway, yanked from this plane
of existence.
</p><p align=left>Another puff of dust billowed out into the air.
</p><p align=left>Bleach-Hair lowered the wand.  I quietly sank back behind the
chicken coop, the unthrown egg still in my hand.
</p><p align=left>"Well, what are you berks waiting for?" Bleach-Hair yelled,
turning to his companions and cuffing their heads.  "We've got
them boxed in now, don't we?  Let's get 'em."
</p><p align=left>He grabbed each man by the shoulder and dragged them forward.
When they reached the portal, all three bashers vanished.
</p><p align=left>The catwalk was empty, save for falling dust.
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="6"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
6. THREE BLOODS TO THE RESCUE
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Racing down the stairs from the rooftop, I had only one
question: what was the portal's key?  The githyanki and githzerai
had been carrying packs; no doubt the key was inside one of those
packs where I couldn't see it.  Kiripao had run through the
portal without activating it, so he didn't have the key.  Yasmin,
however, did--when she dove backward, she had hit the portal
first, carrying Oonah and Kiripao with her.  Then Bleach-Hair had
done the same thing, taking the lead and dragging the other two
behind.
</p><p align=left>But Bleach-Hair had almost nothing on his person: just the
pants he'd stolen from the clothes line...the firewand he'd
borrowed from his cohort...
</p><p align=left>...and the tattoo on his arm.  A picture of himself, that he'd
purchased with his last piece of gold.
</p><p align=left>Need I repeat, Yasmin had been carrying that piking sketch I'd
made of her?
</p><p align=left>A portrait of yourself--that must be the key that opened the
portal.  It was the only answer.  That's why Bleach-Hair had been
so desperate for the tattoo: it was his only way home.
</p><p align=left>I hit the ground running and sped to where Hezekiah lurked in
the alley, still watching the base of the tower.  "What's wrong?"
he asked as I dashed up to him.
</p><p align=left>"They have Yasmin and the others trapped," I answered.
"Enemies in front and behind.  We have to rescue them."
</p><p align=left>"How?"
</p><p align=left>"Take the bad guys by surprise.  Can you cast another teleport
spell?"
</p><p align=left>"It's not exactly a spell," he said.  "I convince myself that
here is there, and the world goes along with the idea just to
humor me."
</p><p align=left>"Explanations later," I told him.  "Can you get us up there?"
</p><p align=left>"Where?"
</p><p align=left>I pointed.  And I pointed again.  And I said a lot of, no, not
that catwalk, the other one, just to the right...no, no, up one
floor, can you see the dogfish...
</p><p align=left>You know how it is.  When you're in a hurry, the people around
you are always impenetrably leatherheaded.  And every second
counted; I had to save Yasmin.  The moment Hezekiah was sure
where to go, I grabbed him and shouted, "Now, now, now!"
</p><p align=left>The world flickered and we were suddenly standing on the edge
of the catwalk.  The very edge...in fact, we teetered on the
verge of falling, with shark-like dogfish circling below us.  By
myself, I could have caught my balance; but Hezekiah had wrapped
his arms around me to make sure we teleported together, and now
he was dragging me over the brink.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah!" I had time to say.  Then someone grabbed the two
of us from behind and pulled us delicately back to safe footing.
</p><p align=left>I turned to see who had saved us from taking the plunge.
There was nobody there.
</p><p align=left>"Wheezle?" I whispered.
</p><p align=left>"A pleasure to be of service, honored Cavendish," answered the
invisible gnome.  "I am surprised to find you here."
</p><p align=left>"It surprised us too," I told him.  "Did you see what happened
when Bleach-Hair caught up with Yasmin and the rest?"
</p><p align=left>"Only from a distance," Wheezle replied.  "Mr. Bleach-Hair's
legs are considerably longer than mine, so I had difficulty
keeping up."
</p><p align=left>"Pity...the others could have used your help.  But it's still
not too late."  I pulled out my sketchbook and a piece of
charcoal.  "It'll just take a second to make a key for that
portal."
</p><p align=left>"What portal?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>I ignored him as I started drawing my own face, but Wheezle
answered the boy's question.  "There is a transplanar portal
anchored in the archway in front of us.  Alas, persons from the
Prime Material plane do not have the attunement to see such
portals, but those of us born in the Outer Planes have no trouble
discerning it."
</p><p align=left>"A portal?" Hezekiah said, squinting at the arch.  "I came
through one of those to get to Sigil.  My Uncle Toby showed me
where it was."
</p><p align=left>"Well, you aren't going through this one," I told him, still
drawing.  "You're heading straight back to Lady Erin so you can
report everything that's happened."
</p><p align=left>"Like what?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>Pausing a second, I ripped off a blank page from my sketchbook
and handed it to the invisible Wheezle.  "Why don't you jot down
everything Lady Erin should know...just in case Hezekiah isn't
sure what's important."
</p><p align=left>"I know what's important," Hezekiah objected.  "And it's not
fair: you get to dash to the rescue while I have to stay in
Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"We don't have time to argue," I snapped.  "Someone has to
rescue our teammates, and someone else has to report to the
authorities.  It's the only sensible plan."
</p><p align=left>"Then you report to the authorities," Hezekiah said.  "I'm
going to save the others."  And he stepped toward the portal.
</p><p align=left>I didn't try to stop him; I doubted that he carried a picture
of himself, and I had a sketch of my own to draw-- every second I
wasted might be one second too many for Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle, however, didn't know what opened the portal and
obviously didn't like taking chances.  "Please, honored
Clueless," he said to Hezekiah, "I cannot permit you to rush in
unwisely."  The paper I'd handed Wheezle fluttered in the air,
then moved toward the portal as the gnome tried to block
Hezekiah's passage.  I had time to think, That's a blank piece of
paper and Wheezle's invisible.  Wouldn't it be a laugh if that
counted as a picture of himself?
</p><p align=left>Then Hezekiah tripped over the invisible gnome, the two of
them pitched forward under the archway, and <WHISH>, the portal
was open.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>You can never see much through a portal, and this one was
murkier than most--a gap of twilight in the middle of Sigil's
afternoon.  The twilight was darkened by a clot of dust clouds,
whirling in thick spirals.  Hezekiah tumbled into those clouds
and out of sight, accompanied by a gnome-shaped silhouette that
briefly broke through the dust.
</p><p align=left>At that moment, something went click in my mind.  Sensates
call it the "once-in-a-lifetime" instinct: an opportunity arises
and you're struck by some premonition that says this chance will
never come again.  You see a cheesecake and your nose tells you
that this is the peak, the pinnacle, that if you pass this one
by, you'll never come close to such perfection ever again...or
you meet a woman at some gathering, and the flames inside you
say, "It has to be her, it has to be tonight, or my soul will
shrivel to ashes."  Our Sensate leaders teach that your once-in-
a-lifetime instinct is almost always wrong--there will be other
cheesecakes, other encounters with this woman or someone equally
fascinating--but they also say who cares?  Pike common sense and
leap in with both feet.
</p><p align=left>Once-in-a-lifetime instinct: see a portal, dive through it.
</p><p align=left>I dove.
</p><p align=left>I dove, throwing caution to the wind.  More precisely, I dove
throwing my sketchbook and charcoal wherever they might fall,
because the portal would close within seconds and I didn't want
to miss it.  One moment, I was traveling through the soot-laden
air of Sigil; and the next, I struck the dust-choked atmosphere
of the other side.
</p><p align=left>Dust enveloped me, as thick as a blanket.  There was no way to
tell when I actually hit the ground--the dust in the air blended
so directly into the dust underfoot that it was all a continuum,
clogging, raspy piles of dust.  I sank up to my elbows before I
finally stopped, and it took all my strength to struggle to my
feet.  Breathing was impossible, and visibility reached less than
an arm's length; a faint gray light barely managed to penetrate
the continually swirling cloud.
</p><p align=left>How long could I hold my breath?  Thirty seconds?  A minute?
How long before I had to fill my lungs with dust?
</p><p align=left>Something loomed in front of me, a slight darkening in the
grayness.  I grabbed at it and pulled it close enough to see; as
I expected, the shadow was Hezekiah, blundering about blindly.
Another moment and he might have been lost forever in the dust
storm.
</p><p align=left>Leatherheaded Clueless--any citizen of Sigil knows, when you
come through a portal into a hostile environment, you never
stumble away from your entry point.  Portals have to anchor
themselves in some kind of archway; figure out what the arch
belongs to, and maybe you've found shelter.
</p><p align=left>Carefully I looked up, keeping a firm grip on the boy's arm.
Sure enough, my eyes blearily made out that we were standing in
the mouth of an open tube, high enough and wide enough that the
walls were only slightly darker blurs in the gray wash of dust.
I staggered forward along the tube with Hezekiah in tow, both of
us pushing against a strong wind that roared into our faces.  The
dust dragged heavily at my feet; and then suddenly, there was
solid floor beneath us.  Moments later, a door shut behind us
with a sigh, closing off the wind and the sifting sound of dust.
</p><p align=left>Silence.  We stood in a small chamber, its walls a dome-like
patchwork made from triangles of glass.  Outside, the dust
continued to swirl in constant motion, dancing close to the glass
but never settling down.  Gray light filtered through the crystal
panes, a light as frail as the thinnest dawn.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin!" Hezekiah whispered sharply.  I turned and saw the
boy standing above a huddled mass that lay in front of a second
door.  A few steps closer and I recognized the shadowy bundle as
a body, lying in a slick of its own blood--a hobgoblin in chain
mail, its lifeless hand still clutching a short sword.
</p><p align=left>"It's some kind of monster," the boy said.
</p><p align=left>"The dead kind," I told him.  "Probably stationed as a guard
on this door when Yasmin, Oonah, and Kiripao showed up.  Poor
berk never knew what hit him."
</p><p align=left>"Now let us rejoice that his journey is done," said a third
voice in the room.  "He has shed the burden of life and found the
purity that awaits all creatures in the cup of oblivion."
</p><p align=left>"Hello, Wheezle," I sighed.  "Cheerful as ever."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed, sir," the invisible gnome said.  "The other Dustmen
often remark on my high spirits."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah looked like he was going to ask a stupid question.  I
covered his mouth with my hand.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Now," I said, "the original plan still stands.  Hezekiah goes
back to Sigil, while Wheezle and I stay to rescue the others.
Don't argue, there isn't time."
</p><p align=left>"But how do I get back to Sigil?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"You go back to the portal and you..."  I stopped.  To open
the portal, he needed a picture of himself; and I no longer had
my sketchbook.  "Wheezle, I don't suppose you still have that
paper I gave you?"
</p><p align=left>"In the confusion of falling through the portal, I fear I let
the paper go."
</p><p align=left>And now it was blowing out there in the storm, or buried under
a couple feet of dust.  "Blast!" I muttered, trying to think of
anything else I could use to draw a picture of the boy.  Nothing
came to mind, and time was passing quickly.  "All right," I told
Hezekiah, "you're on the rescue team for now.  But the second we
find some way to draw a picture of you, you're going back to
Sigil to report."
</p><p align=left>"Once we rescue the others," the boy answered, "we can all
report."
</p><p align=left>"Pray that you're right," I nodded.  "Just remember we're in
unknown territory.  Be careful, be quiet, and don't touch
anything!"
</p><p align=left>"Yes, sir," he saluted.  And he immediately pushed the button
that opened the door the hobgoblin had been guarding.
</p><p align=left>Under other circumstances, that would have earned him a couple
arrows in the chest--two archers had been stationed on the other
side of the door, crossbows ready and waiting.  Fortunately for
the boy, Yasmin and the others had come through ahead of us; the
bow strings had been cut, along with the throats of the two men.
</p><p align=left>"Are you completely addle-coved?" I snapped at Hezekiah.  "You
don't just barge through doors like that!  Wheezle, you take the
lead...and keep a sharp eye out for traps."
</p><p align=left>"Yes, honored Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>Something invisible nudged the boy out of the doorway, and he
stepped aside.  A corridor extended for more than a hundred paces
ahead of us, its floor ramping gradually upward.  Like the first
room, this corridor's roof and walls were made from triangles of
glass fitted snugly together in a metal framework.  Wan gray
light filtered in from outside, so feeble it seemed the light
itself had somehow become disheartened.
</p><p align=left>As we hurried up the ramp, the dust storm outside tapered off.
By the look of it, the dust only tossed itself about near the
entrance to the building; once we had gained some height, we
could see that the dust lay flat and quiet farther off.  The
flatness had an eerie quality to it--in a normal desert, the wind
leaves ripples in the sand or heaps the surface into dunes.
Here, however, the dust lay as evenly as sifted flour.  No scrub
brush, no cacti, no hills or valleys...just a motionless expanse
of dust stretching flat to the horizon.
</p><p align=left>"Creepy, isn't it?" Hezekiah whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Yasmin would love it," I replied.  "The very essence of
entropy.  Wheezle probably likes the view too."
</p><p align=left>"Not especially, honored sir," the gnome answered.  "I revere
Death; this place is simply lifeless.  It's not the same thing."
</p><p align=left>The corridor ended at an open door which led into a chamber
stinking of smoke.  Not so long ago, the room must have been a
comfortable lounge, equipped with adequately upholstered chairs
and well-cushioned divans; but some time in the past few minutes,
a battle had ripped the place to shambles.  The far half of the
room was scorched black, walls caked with soot and furniture
burned to the springs.  The near half sparkled with a thick layer
of hoar frost, couches and chairs encased in ice.  Where the
halves joined, icicles dripped down from the ceiling, slowly
extinguishing the dribbles of fire still smouldering from the
furniture.
</p><p align=left>Almost without thinking, I reached up and broke off one long
icicle.  I had always found icicles a comfort to suck-- cold and
clear, with a sharp point on the end that danced with your
tongue.  This icicle, however, tasted of smoke and soot; I spat
out its water and tossed it away.
</p><p align=left>No bodies here.  No evidence to suggest who won.  But one way
or another, the fight was over.  If Yasmin and the others had
lost...well, in the absence of corpses, I could tell myself
they'd simply been taken prisoner.  All we had to do was find
them and stage a rescue.  Of course, if they'd won this fight,
they must be exploring the area ahead and could still use our
help.  Either way, they'd be glad to see us.
</p><p align=left>If they could still see.  I couldn't help remembering the
burnt bodies of the court rotunda, their eyes scorched out of the
sockets.
</p><p align=left>No.  That couldn't happen to Yasmin.  Her eyes were
too...worth looking into.
</p><p align=left>The battle-scarred room had two exits, one right, one left.
Both had once been closed with sliding doors, but the doors had
blown off their tracks thanks to the barrage of magic unleashed
in the fight.  I glanced out both doorways but saw nothing to
indicate which direction our teammates had gone.
</p><p align=left>"Given a choice," Hezekiah whispered, "I always go left."
</p><p align=left>That gave me a strong urge to go right, but I resisted.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The left corridor curved around in an arc, circling away from
the entrance we came in.  I had no idea what this whole building
was, but it resembled a huge central ring with the occasional
ramp-like corridor radiating outward from the center, like spokes
from the hub of a wheel.  We had come in along one spoke; looking
out the window, I could see another spoke-corridor some distance
in front of us.  At the free end of the spoke ahead, a dust storm
swirled in the air, just like the storm where we had entered.  I
wondered if that spoke had a portal too...if all the spokes had
portals as exits from this bleak dustscape.  Perhaps this
building shot air out the mouth of each spoke to keep dust from
clogging the portal--it made as much sense as any other theory
that came to mind.
</p><p align=left>For the moment such questions could wait...but curiosity
dogged me on one other point.  If the heart of this building was
a circular ring, what was inside the middle?  I didn't know.  The
outer wall of this corridor might be made of those small
triangles of glass, but the inner wall was sheet metal, polished
to a mirror-like shine.  All that wall showed was the haggard
face of one Britlin Cavendish, his goatee and hair so streaked
with dust they looked white instead of their usual fetching
black.
</p><p align=left>In time, we approached the next spoke around the ring.  Its
construction followed the same design as the first corridor, with
a large chamber at the point where the spoke connected with the
central hub; but the door between us and the chamber was closed.
</p><p align=left>I waved at Hezekiah to stand back and walked up to plant my
ear on the door.  It was made of the same metal as the walls, and
probably too thick to let sound pass through; but pausing to
listen, futile though the gesture was, gave me a few extra
seconds to debate what to do next.  Enter fast or slow?  Brash or
sneaky?
</p><p align=left>"Ah, pike it," I muttered.  "Time's a'wasting."
</p><p align=left>The door was operated by a button on the metal wall.  I kicked
the button with my heel at the same time as I drew my sword.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>With a soft swish, the door slid open.  The only thing to
emerge was an awful stench, like standing in the alley between a
slaughterhouse and a tannery--the dull heaviness of blood and
decay, overlaid with the piercing sharpness of harsh chemicals.
I took a second or two to enjoy the bouquet, trying to identify
the components by smell: certainly a lot of vinegar, and copper,
and sulphur, and a dash of quicklime...but there were many more
ingredients that eluded me, and no more time for sniffing.  Wary
of attack, I stepped into the room to see what made the reek.
</p><p align=left>Bodies: corpses heaped in a mound that nearly reached the
ceiling.  About half were human, both male and female.  The rest
were an assortment from the other common races of the
multiverse--elves, dwarves, hobgoblins, even a tiefling or two.
Arms dangled limply.  Many eyes were open and staring.  Most of
the dead wore clothes, some dressed quite elegantly; but a few
were simply naked, tossed on the mound like refuse.
</p><p align=left>I could see no injuries on any of these people, no indication
of what killed them.  The few closest to me looked like they had
been young and healthy; the rest were simply hidden by shadows,
and by the tangled mass of other corpses lying on top of them.
</p><p align=left>"This is appalling," Wheezle whispered.  From the sound of his
voice, our invisible Dustman was standing quite close to the
mound of bodies.  A moment later, I noticed the hair rustling on
the head of a gnome woman: invisible fingers combed through her
curls, straightening out the snarls.
</p><p align=left>"Appalling," Wheezle whispered again.
</p><p align=left>"I thought you rejoiced in death," I said.
</p><p align=left>"Clean death," he replied.  "Pure death.  But the dead deserve
to be treated with dignity.  These...can't you smell it?"
</p><p align=left>"The chemicals?"  I took a deep whiff again.  Now that I was
inside the room, the acrid stench was as sharp as a needle,
stinging in my nose; I kept inhaling until the stink filled the
back of my throat with its heady rasp.  Then, of course, I
collapsed to my knees, coughing uncontrollably.  "Good smell," I
gasped between coughs.
</p><p align=left>"It is the smell of...certain vegetable extracts," Wheezle
told me, clearly unwilling to be more specific.  "They are used
by ignorant ruffians who believe these extracts can reanimate the
dead."
</p><p align=left>"The extracts don't work?"
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps one time in a hundred, the technique creates a
wight," Wheezle replied.  "These bodies are obviously the
failures.  But the low reanimation rate is only a minor concern.
The great problem is..."  I could hear him shuffling his feet in
agitation.  "The great problem is energy.  Undead beings do not
eat or drink or breathe--in order to move, they must derive their
energy from other sources.  Most are nourished by the unlimited
magicks of the cosmos, as channeled through deities and other
powers who rule the undead.  It gives the undead a direct
connection with the forces that sustain the multiverse...a
profound spiritual link with the Great Blackness.
</p><p align=left>"But undead created through alchemical means..."  Wheezle's
voice choked tight with anger.  "They are like candles who burn
their own tallow.  They are...closed in.  Shut off from external
energies.  They have no link with the gods of the undead.  Such
beings can only survive by consuming the energy of their own
souls--burning themselves down and down, like rats starving to
death in a cage.  It is an ugly fate."
</p><p align=left>I looked at the mound of bodies again, trying to detect any
difference between these corpses and others I'd seen.  No sign of
rigor mortis in any of them, despite the overwhelming stench of
decay.  Was that unusual?  I didn't know.  As an artist, I'm only
familiar with living subjects.
</p><p align=left>The boy Hezekiah also seemed curious about the bodies heaped
before us.  "So these failures," he began; "are they just dead?
Or are they conscious, even if they can't move?"
</p><p align=left>"They have a type of consciousness," Wheezle nodded.  "They
simply do not have enough self-energy to stir themselves.  Their
souls will wither in time...unless, of course, we can free them
from their damnation."
</p><p align=left>I didn't like the tone in his voice.  Much as I recognized the
horror of rotting away in your own corpse, I'd rather concentrate
on saving a live Yasmin than dead strangers.  Still, I had to ask
one more question about the different types of undead.  "Tell
me," I said to the invisible gnome.  "If someone used alchemy
like this to create wights, would the wights obey the Dead
Truce?"
</p><p align=left>"The Truce is a pact between my faction and the gods of the
undead," Wheezle replied.  "These chemical abominations are cut
off from the gods; that is their curse.  Therefore, this kind of
undead live outside the Truce."
</p><p align=left>"So," said Hezekiah, "those wights who attacked the Dustmen at
the Mortuary must have been the few successes out of all these--"
</p><p align=left>I clapped a hand over his mouth.  My ears had picked up a
slight rustle of sound.  Listening harder, I heard it again: not
from the corpses nor the corridor where we'd entered, but from
the door in front of us, leading farther around the ring of the
building.  The door was metal and closed tightly, but a murmur of
voices still came through indistinctly.
</p><p align=left>Keeping my hand over the boy's mouth, I circled the mound of
corpses, hoping there'd be enough room to hide at the rear.
There wasn't: the bodies were stacked tight against the wall,
with no space to slide behind them.  The voices down the corridor
were getting louder...so I shoved Hezekiah down beside me and
burrowed straight into the corpse-heap.
</p><p align=left>Neither of us could dig in very deeply--the heap must have
massed several tons in dead weight.  Still, we could force our
way past the outer tangle of arms and legs, to a point where we
blended into the whole.  I prayed that would be good enough.
</p><p align=left>The intruders' loud conversation covered our grunting as we
squeezed into the press of tattered clothes and naked skin.
Every exposed patch of dead flesh reeked with the stench of
chemicals and decay, but I fought back the coughs that ragged my
throat.  I didn't know how many people were about to enter this
chamber; I just knew we wouldn't be able to hear them from so far
away unless they vastly outnumbered us.  With a last surge of
strength I pulled my legs inside the pile, just as the door
whisked open and dozens of feet strutted into the room.
</p><p align=left>I couldn't see the newcomers, couldn't see anything but the
lifeless face of a young woman close to mine.  Her eyes were
open, with the blind stillness of the dead.  Death surrounded
me--my left hand rested on someone's leg and my other arm was
jammed under a woman's stomach.  There was enough air to breathe,
but I held my breath.
</p><p align=left>"All right," called a man's voice.  "Everybody stop rattling
your bone-boxes.  Come on, I want quiet!"  The talk subsided.
"That's better," the man said.  "Now, let's see if this thing
works."
</p><p align=left>I gritted my teeth.  Whatever "this thing" might be, I knew I
wasn't going to like it.  The speaker might even be testing a
newly made firewand by incinerating the mound of corpses where
Hezekiah and I lay hidden.
</p><p align=left>The man recited a few nonsense syllables, his voice uncertain
and stilted, as if he were reading the chant from a piece of
paper.  A moment later, there was a soft chuffing sound followed
by a crackle, like the crinkly edge of lightning before the full
thunder's boom.  A wand of storms? I asked myself.  But then the
weight of the corpse-heap shifted and I heard leather-soled boots
hitting the floor.
</p><p align=left>Something hissed fiercely--a type of hiss that was all too
familiar.  A wight's hiss.
</p><p align=left>Several people in the room gasped.  Several more whispered to
each other, words I couldn't make out.  Slowly, the whispering
changed to a murmur of approval: "Amazing!"  "Brilliant!"  "Pike
me with a feather!"
</p><p align=left>"Take a look at it!" cried the man who was obviously in
charge.  "Our very own soul-sucker.  You'll never see a handsomer
corpse.  Say hello, deadman."
</p><p align=left>There was another loud hiss.  The group of onlookers cheered.
</p><p align=left>"Tickle one of the ladies next!" shouted a male voice.  "I
want me a new dance partner."
</p><p align=left>Male voices laughed, but a female voice called, "You don't
need a new partner, you need a new dance."
</p><p align=left>Female voices laughed at that one.
</p><p align=left>"Bar that talk," snapped the leader.  "We have work to do.
Stand back, all of you."
</p><p align=left>The buzz of conversation diminished as the leader started
again: the muttered nonsense words; the chuffing noise; the
crackle of lightning; then the mound of bodies shifted as another
corpse pulled itself to its feet.  Again and again the process
repeated...until the leader said, "All right, that's four of
them.  Theresa, this'll be your team; lead 'em down to the lock."
</p><p align=left>"Right, captain," replied a woman's voice.
</p><p align=left>"And you undead berks," continued the captain, "you're going
to take orders from Theresa, right?"
</p><p align=left>He was answered with a chorus of hisses.
</p><p align=left>"Good.  Don't give her no grief.  Now off you go."
</p><p align=left>I heard footsteps slowly recede--one person walking normally,
and four shuffling behind.  Four wights pulled off the pile; four
less bodies hiding Hezekiah and me.
</p><p align=left>The process continued: corpses reanimated in groups of four,
then each group sent off under the guidance of a living person.
The darkness around me began to brighten as the mass of bodies
decreased.  Soon everything above my level would be gone, leaving
me at the top of the pile.  At that point...things would get
interesting.
</p><p align=left>Lightning crackled and the woman lying on my arm came to life.
She pushed herself upward, planting her hands on my shoulder for
support.  As she crawled across me, her knee dug forcefully into
my back; I clenched my jaw to avoid grunting in pain.  That woman
was the last of another group of four, and she was quickly
marched off under some living lackey's leadership.  How many
active enemies did that leave in the room?  I didn't know, and
couldn't lift my head to look.
</p><p align=left>The next corpse reanimated was the woman with her face next to
mine.  I saw the transformation: one moment, she was blind and
staring; then chuff, crackle, and jagged threads of blue light
came lacing through her skin like bloated veins.  Her eyes
blinked once, lazily...she was staring right in my face.  Then,
twin pinpricks of fire erupted at the heart of her pupils,
flaring outward until the entire surface of the eye blazed with
flame.  I could feel the heat on my cheeks.
</p><p align=left>She hissed directly at me and lifted one hand.  The hand was
sharp with newly grown claws.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Horror clutched at my heart, and I rolled away from the
newborn wight, slipping out from under the few corpses that still
weighed me down.  The wight swiped her claws at me but missed;
her hand slashed cleanly through the body beneath me, shredding
the putrefied flesh.  A fresh stink of rot and chemicals filled
my nose, heady with nausea...but I continued my roll to the edge
of the corpse-heap, sliding down the exterior like the side of a
haystack.  Even as I fell, I was grabbing for my sword, tugging
to clear it from its sheath.
</p><p align=left>The bodies I brushed past slowed my fall, softening my impact
on the floor.  As soon as I landed, I scrambled to my feet and
checked the opposition.  Only two of the enemy squad remained,
thank The Lady: a hobgoblin with its back to me and a drow, a
dark elf, holding a bulbous scepter that glowed a sickly orange.
The drow simply gaped, astonished at a corpse coming to life
unaided.  As for the hobgoblin, it turned to see what the drow
was staring at...which only made my job easier, giving me a clear
opening to hit the soft part of its throat.  My rapier slashed
out once, bit deep, and severed whatever hobgoblins have in place
of a jugular.  Its blood sprayed gushers over the pile of still-
dead bodies.
</p><p align=left>Something roared within the pile.  For a moment, I thought it
was the wight who'd tried to rake me with her claws--I could see
her struggling to escape from the corpses still lying on top of
her.  Then a huddle of lifeless bodies suddenly heaved onto the
drow as Hezekiah rose from the mound, roaring a battle cry.  The
drow fell cursing to the floor, struggling to lift his scepter
despite the weight of corpses pinning his arms.  Before he could
manage it, the scepter was snatched from his hand by Wheezle, the
little gnome finally turning visible as he scrambled away with
his prize.
</p><p align=left>For a moment, we all stood waiting: me with my blade embedded
in the hobgoblin's neck, Hezekiah wobbling to keep his balance on
top of the corpse-heap, and Wheezle catching his breath as he
leaned against the wall.  Then the wight wrenched herself free
from the mound and threw herself at the drow, slamming down where
he was still pinioned by bodies.  The wight's own body prevented
me from seeing what happened next; but the drow gave a wailing
scream of terror that ended abruptly in a gurgle.
</p><p align=left>Clearly, Madame Wight was not affectionately disposed toward
the man who woke her from her nap.
</p><p align=left>"Stop!" Wheezle shouted.  Hezekiah and I weren't moving, so he
must have been talking to the wight; and sure enough, she rose
from her kill peacefully, licking blood off her claws with great
satisfaction.  She even took a moment to look my way and smile.
The smile appeared friendly enough...if only her teeth didn't
have points as sharp as spikes.
</p><p align=left>First things first, however--I ran to the door and pushed the
button to close it.  The last thing I wanted was a friend of the
drow prancing back with four wights in tow, coming to investigate
why someone screamed.
</p><p align=left>The door slid shut quietly.  Seconds dripped by and nothing
happened.  At last I let my breath out with a relieved sigh.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said, "will someone please tell me what's going
on?"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"I do not know all the answers, honored Cavendish," Wheezle
began, "but this scepter tells me many things."
</p><p align=left>"The scepter talks?" Hezekiah asked with interest.  He was
still perched atop the corpse-heap, but he had lowered himself
into a cross-legged sitting position where he seemed quite
comfortable.  "Uncle Toby once had a garden hoe that talked, but
he sold it at the fall fair."
</p><p align=left>"The scepter does not talk, honored Clueless, but its presence
here explains much.  My faction calls this weapon Klemt
Ur't'haleem, which might be translated as Unveiler.  Unveiler is
the creation of...a certain god, whose name it is unwise to speak
aloud.  Many centuries ago, the scepter came into the hands of
the Dustmen; by which I mean that a party of Dustmen freed it
from its former owner, and gave that owner a prominent place in
our factol's retinue of zombies."
</p><p align=left>"So Unveiler belonged to the Dustmen and now it's here," I
said.  "That tells us what the thieves were doing at the Mortuary
this morning."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed," Wheezle nodded.  "They must have used the exploding
giant as a diversion while they crept inside and stole the
scepter."
</p><p align=left>"So what does this Unveiler do?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"It gives the user extraordinary powers to control the
alchemical undead," Wheezle replied.  "It can even animate these
pathetic corpses and fill them with energy; but for all that, it
is still a despicable object.  This poor creature..."  He pointed
to the wight, still greedily licking blood off her fingers.  "She
is out of touch with the cosmos.  She cannot commune with the
undead gods.  Her death is a stifled, paltry thing."
</p><p align=left>I couldn't see any stifled quality myself--she looked quite
happy for a corpse.  However, Wheezle was the expert in such
matters, so I deferred to his judgment.
</p><p align=left>"If the scepter is evil," Hezekiah said, "maybe we should
break it."
</p><p align=left>"My faction has tried," Wheezle told him.  "Alas, it is too
powerful.  The best we could do was hide it in the Mortuary until
we found a way to unmake it."
</p><p align=left>"And the thieves must have stolen it because they were sick of
the high failure rate from their alchemy," I said.  "Probably
those three wights we killed back at the Mortuary were the only
ones they had actually managed to get moving.  Unveiler let them
power up this whole pile of discards."
</p><p align=left>"That is a reasonable conclusion," Wheezle nodded.  "The enemy
obviously has need of an army of undead servants."
</p><p align=left>"As if we don't have enough headaches already," I muttered.
"Still, we have the scepter now; does that mean we can control
the wights?"
</p><p align=left>"Any wights who see it in our possession will obey us,"
Wheezle said.  "We can turn them against their creators...as a
temporary measure."
</p><p align=left>"Why temporary?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"These unfortunates must be freed," the gnome replied.  "We
cannot leave them in their current condition.  Yes, an army of
wights might help us defeat our enemies, and I will reluctantly
tolerate such an army until the task is accomplished.  Once that
is done, however, these souls must be released.  The energy
injection from this wand only lasts a few weeks--like throwing a
few extra sticks of wood into a stove.  Once that wood has been
used, the wights begin to burn their own souls again.  I will not
be party to that."
</p><p align=left>"And you have a way to release them?" Hezekiah piped up.
</p><p align=left>I wished the boy hadn't said that.
</p><p align=left>With a wave of his hand, Wheezle shouted something that
sounded like, "Hoksha ptock!"  Unveiler's orange glow curdled to
a bilious green, casting sickly shadows over the heap of corpses.
Bodies rustled like leaves; a few of them uttered heavy groans.
The wight who had been licking her fingers gave a startled jerk,
as if the ground had suddenly quaked beneath her.  She turned to
me with a puzzled look on her face, the flames in her eyes
sputtering like a dampened fire.  Her mouth let out a bewildered
hiss...then her legs buckled and she fell to the floor.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah, still sitting on top of the corpse-heap, yelped and
tried to catch his balance.  The bodies beneath him were
shifting, muttering incomprehensibly.  As fast as he could, the
boy scrambled off the mound, running to my side as if I would
protect him from whatever happened next.
</p><p align=left>No need.  The one active wight was on her knees, rocking back
and forth like a child trying to comfort herself.  The corpses
too were moving, the whole pile shuddering in pulses.  The
muttering sounds grew louder, slowly blending together until all
the bodies were moaning in unison, "Huhhhh...huhhhh...huhhhh..."
</p><p align=left>"Hoksha ptock!" Wheezle cried again.
</p><p align=left>"Ahhhhhhh," the corpses sighed, and the wight hissed along.
"Ahhhhh..."
</p><p align=left>"Hoksha ptock!"
</p><p align=left>Then, with a soft gooey sound, every dead body turned
liquid--a runny brown liquid collapsing onto the floor with a
loud splash, as gooey as egg whites.  The fluid surged up to my
feet like an ocean tide, flowing over my boots in a wave.
Hezekiah tried to jump away, but there was nowhere to go: the
spill of liquefying bodies covered the floor.  We were both
awash, up to the ankles.
</p><p align=left>"Yuck!" the boy shouted.  "Euuu!"
</p><p align=left>"Do not fear," Wheezle said calmly.  "It is a form of
ectoplasm.  Not dangerous in any way."
</p><p align=left>"So it's not poisonous?" I asked.  "Good."
</p><p align=left>The taste was something like olive oil, but saltier.  With a
little vinegar, it might make a fine salad dressing.
</p>

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
7. THREE SLABS OF CLAY
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>"We have done a great thing this day," Wheezle said.  "The
undead gods will not forget us."
</p><p align=left>"Is that a good thing?" Hezekiah whispered to me.
</p><p align=left>"Probably not," I whispered back.  "But I'd rather have them
pleased with us than angry."  In a louder voice, I said to
Wheezle, "Of course you realize you've destroyed...sorry,
freed...a lot of corpses who could have been on our side."
</p><p align=left>"They would not truly be our allies, honored Cavendish.  You
must have observed how quickly the wight killed the drow once I
took control of the scepter.  Undead animated in this way always
despise the persons responsible.  The wights cannot resist direct
commands from their creators, but they do their best to twist
those commands contrary to the original intent.  We will do
better taking over the wights created by others--those wights
will be grateful to us, at least for a time."
</p><p align=left>I had to grant the truth of what he said.  Wights would never
be trustworthy for long, but the one we freed from the drow had
smiled at me in a friendly manner...until Wheezle turned her into
brown goop all over my boots.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said.  "Let's find more wights and tear this
place apart."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>With a swish, the door opened in front of us.  Wheezle took
the lead; he was no longer invisible, but he carried
Unveiler...something we wanted the wandering undead to see as
soon as possible.  I followed Wheezle and Hezekiah followed me.
</p><p align=left>The corridor continued to curve before us, following the
building's central ring.  This time, however, the inner wall was
not opaque metal--it was another triangular patchwork of glass,
finally revealing what lay inside the ring.
</p><p align=left>The center was simply a bed of dust, light brown in the gray
light.  Our building surrounded the dust like an arena around a
playing field, raised about two storeys above the surface.  The
enclosed region was enormous, a circle about four hundred yards
in diameter--the far side of the ring was only a dim shadow in
the grayness.
</p><p align=left>For a moment, I thought the dust floor was completely empty.
Then I caught some motion a quarter way around the ring.  Asking
Wheezle to stop for a moment, I pressed my nose against one of
the glass triangles and peered out at the unmoving dust.
</p><p align=left>Four figures had just emerged from a door at the base of the
building, figures who moved with the peculiar arm-swinging gait
of wights.  Slowly, they waded into the arena, dust up to their
thighs: a team of wights walking directly forward, swinging their
claws to scoop up handfuls of dust and throw it over their heads.
</p><p align=left>The disturbed dust did not drift down slowly as I might have
expected--it fell as fast as stones.  Was each dust mote as heavy
as a boulder?  No, the wights showed no strain as they tossed
around handfuls of the stuff.  After a few moments' thought, the
explanation struck me: the arena had no air.  The dust didn't
drift because there was nothing for it to drift upon; with no air
resistance, the dust fell as fast as anything else.
</p><p align=left>"No wonder they wanted to manufacture all those wights," I
murmured.  "Whatever they're up to down there, they need
creatures that don't have to breathe."
</p><p align=left>As we continued along the corridor, I glanced out the window
from time to time.  More and more wights were wading into the
dust--all the four-monster teams that had been assembled while
Hezekiah and I hid in the corpse-heap.  They soon spread around
the whole circle, simply walking and throwing dust in the air.
</p><p align=left>"They're searching for something," Hezekiah said in a low
voice.
</p><p align=left>"You think so?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>The boy nodded.  "There must be something buried in the dust
and they're trying to find it."
</p><p align=left>For once, Hezekiah appeared to be right.  The wights slowly
worked their way across the surface, sweeping through the dust
with their hands.  I wouldn't call it a methodical search; but
perhaps this random wandering was one way the wights could do a
bad job for their masters without actually disobeying orders.
</p><p align=left>In time, we heard the sound of shuffling feet directly ahead
of us--four wights with a hobgoblin guide.  Before I could stop
him, Wheezle simply called, "Hello!" and waved the scepter.  The
instant the wights saw that someone new held Unveiler, they
turned on the hobgoblin and ripped him to gobbets of bloody meat.
</p><p align=left>"Wheezle," I said, "next time, let's try to take one of these
berks alive.  If we can interrogate a prisoner, we might learn
useful things."
</p><p align=left>"A hundred apologies, honored Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>Since the phrase was usually "a thousand apologies", I don't
think Wheezle was particularly contrite.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>We continued on our way with the four liberated wights
trundling amiably behind us.  Wheezle had chatted with them
briefly, offering them a choice of being "freed" immediately or
accompanying us on our hunting mission.  All four were hissingly
eager to slice into more of their former masters...which should
be a warning to all you readers who want to create wights of your
own.
</p><p align=left>The wights trotted along at a healthy speed, far faster than
the sullen shuffle they had shown previously.  In minutes, we had
caught up with the next team of four, this group led by a human
woman.  "Take her alive!" Wheezle shouted as soon as her party
came into view; and a heartbeat later, the woman was pinned
against the glass wall by her former followers.
</p><p align=left>With four pointy-toothed wights grinning malevolently in her
face, the woman opened her mouth to scream.  Immediately, one of
the wights stuffed its hand between her lips, pressing her head
back hard against the glass panes.  She still screamed, as any
sensible person might with a corpse's hand thrust into her mouth;
but the muffled sound went nowhere.
</p><p align=left>As I trotted up to her, I told the wights, "Don't hurt
her...for the moment."  I said it only for the woman's
benefit--as long as Wheezle held Unveiler, the wights didn't care
a pin about orders from me.
</p><p align=left>The woman's eyes were wide and watery, glaring at me with
vicious fury.  She was in her early thirties, of middling height
but very wiry.  Up where the wights held her hands, her knuckles
each sported a thick knot of callus, as if she liked to use her
fists on passers-by; Brother Kiripao's knuckles had an identical
set of calluses.
</p><p align=left>"Hello," I said to her.  "I'm going to ask this nice wight to
take his hand out of your mouth...and if you behave, he won't
have to put it back in.  All right?"
</p><p align=left>Grudgingly, she nodded.  "Do what he says," Wheezle murmured
to the wights, tapping Unveiler lightly against his thigh.
</p><p align=left>The wight slowly removed its hand, watching for any sign the
woman might try to scream again.  However, the hard-edged
expression on her face showed that her initial outburst had been
a one-time reaction; now she wanted to show how tough she was.
"Who are you?" she growled.
</p><p align=left>"We don't have time to exchange life stories," I said.
"You're going to tell us everything we want to know, and you're
going to keep answering our questions until we say otherwise."
</p><p align=left>"If I don't, you're going to feed me to the wights?"
</p><p align=left>The wights all leered with their pointed teeth, but I shook my
head.  "That would be too easy.  If you won't talk, I'll turn you
over to...The Kid."
</p><p align=left>Dramatically, I spun around and pointed at Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>"Me?" he gulped.
</p><p align=left>"Him!" I said, turning back to the woman.  "Looks like a gawky
little Clueless, doesn't he?  Too stupid to live.  I wish I had a
ducat for every person who's thought that...every corpse left
festering in an alley, the body mutilated and the face frozen in
agony.  Look at him again.  Can anyone really be that much of a
leatherhead?  Or is it just an act to make you think he's
harmless?"
</p><p align=left>"Britlin..." Hezekiah began, but I stopped him quickly.
</p><p align=left>"No!" I cried, cringing in front of him.  "Don't be angry with
me for giving away your secret.  Please, master,
don't...don't..."  I stumbled against him, and in reflex, the boy
reached out to steady me.  The moment his hand touched my
shoulder, I gasped, "Oh saints, the pain!" and collapsed,
whimpering.
</p><p align=left>"Please," Wheezle said to the woman, "please, honored lady,
you see I am a Dustman and no stranger to death.  Yet even I
cannot bear the hideous atrocities which this youth might visit
upon your person.  They claim he learned the arts of torture from
the Lords of the Abyss.  Surely you have heard of him?  Surely
you have heard of...The Kid."
</p><p align=left>A pity I was down on the ground, moaning like a barmy-- I
would have given a pound of gold to see the expression on the
woman's face.  Or on Hezekiah's face, for that matter.  Still, I
hoped the boy would have the wit to play along with the act; if
we didn't scare this woman with cheap theatrics, we'd have to use
real torture to get information out of her.  That would mean
noise and delay and a burden of guilt I preferred to avoid.
</p><p align=left>Carefully, Hezekiah stepped over me and approached the woman.
I groaned louder and wondered if the boy was about to mess up my
plan.  "Don't let these berks peel you," he said in a passable
imitation of a Sigil accent.  "I'm really quite harmless."
</p><p align=left>And then, suddenly, Hezekiah was terrifying.  From my position
on the floor, all I could see was his boots; and they were the
most frightening boots I had ever seen in my life.  Terrible
visions erupted in my mind, showing those boots kicking me
mercilessly, breaking bones, crushing the skulls of children and
grinding eyeballs under their heels.
</p><p align=left>Boots marching over the stubble of scorched fields.
</p><p align=left>Boots stamping face after face, annihilating every flicker of
life.
</p><p align=left>Then, just as suddenly, Hezekiah was once more just a Clueless
youth, innocent and ungainly.  "You see?" he said in his normal
voice.  "I'm harmless."
</p><p align=left>I moaned, and this time the moan was no act.  It took all my
strength to stop myself from shivering in the afterchill of
terror.  My sudden unreasoning fear must have come from magic, of
course--some spell cast by Wheezle or Hezekiah himself, to make
the little leatherhead seem monstrous; but my usual composure was
shattered by the experience.  I found myself asking which was the
illusion: the suddenly horrendous aura surrounding the boy, or
perhaps his usual bumbling persona.  What did I really know about
him?  A Clueless hick who just happened to know high-powered
magic...did that make sense?
</p><p align=left>"Keep him away from me!" the woman shouted.
</p><p align=left>"I do not have authority over The Kid," Wheezle answered.
"But if you tell what you know, perhaps he will not trouble
himself to make an example of you."

</p><p align=left>"All right, I'll talk," she said.  And she did.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>

</p><p align=left>Her name was Miriam and she didn't know much.  Ten days ago,
she'd been a streetcorner thug in Sigil, playing the protection
peel over a few blocks of dingy shops: "Cross my palm with
silver, or I'll burn your place down."  When some basher in a
tavern offered her a heavy purse in exchange for three weeks of
strong-arm work, she'd said yes.  That's how she'd come here to
the Plane of Dust.
</p><p align=left>Yes, this really was the Plane of Dust that Oonah had
mentioned a few days earlier.  The plane was nothing but an
infinite ocean of dust--no water, no air, just dust untouched by
the slightest wind.  I'd heard a rumor that the Doomguard
maintained a citadel somewhere on this plane, because it was the
sort of lifeless place that appealed to their sensibilities; but
this building didn't belong to the Doomguard.  Miriam told us we
were standing inside the Glass Spider..."Glass" because of its
see-through walls, even though they were constructed from
something much more indestructible than ordinary window panes.
The "Spider" part of the name came from the building's shape: a
circular central body almost half a mile in diameter, with eight
arms radiating outward around the circumference.  Each arm was a
long sloping corridor like the one where we'd come in, and the
outer end of each housed a portal to some other part of the
multiverse.
</p><p align=left>The most surprising aspect of the Glass Spider was that it
could move.  Miriam claimed the Spider's legs could crawl through
the dust faster than an eagle could fly, stirring up silt in
mammoth plumes that streamed away for miles behind the speeding
bug.  It had been racing through the dust for most of the past
week, covering a hundred leagues every hour; but a short while
ago it had finally stopped, apparently at its journey's end.
</p><p align=left>What was the Spider's purpose?  Who built it?  Miriam didn't
know, but at least she could list the people who had arrived with
her ten days ago.
</p><p align=left>Her immediate superior had been the drow back at the corpse-
heap; since the wights had torn him to bloody confetti, we didn't
bother asking his name.
</p><p align=left>The drow's boss was our old friend Bleach-Hair, his real name
Petrov.  Petrov hailed from some Prime Material world whose
predominant landscape was ice; Miriam didn't remember the world's
name, and none of us cared.  (I might comment, by the way, that
so-called ice worlds usually have their share of green fields,
lakes, and even jungles; when someone like Petrov says he comes
from an ice world, he almost always comes from a perfectly normal
world and just lived in an icy part of it.  Folk of the Prime
Material plane are so parochial they seldom know much about their
own homes, let alone the multiverse at large.)
</p><p align=left>Petrov occupied the second highest rung on the ladder of
command.  Above him were two powerful figures who shared control
of everything that happened in the Glass Spider.  One was a human
mage who called himself "The Fox"...although Miriam contended
"The Loon" was a more appropriate title.  The Fox loved fire the
way another man might love women; he could gaze at flames for
hours, talking to the blaze and showing every sign of listening
to it talk back.  Thanks to various magic spells, he could even
caress fire, bathe in it, wear it like a cloak.  Needless to say,
the Fox manufactured the firewands used at the courts, and
masterminded all the other fiery accidents that had struck
faction headquarters in Sigil.  The very first incident--the riot
at the Gatehouse asylum--had started when the Fox broke out of a
padded cell where he had been confined for years.
</p><p align=left>The Fox had managed his escape with the help of the other
leader of this group, a human woman named Rivi.  She was not a
sorcerer--Miriam claimed that Rivi hated sorcerers, although she
got along well with a barmy like the Fox--but Rivi could still do
things that struck Miriam as magic: reading minds, for example,
or projecting her thoughts through the building to give orders to
underlings.
</p><p align=left>"Oh," said Hezekiah.  "Rivi must be psionic."
</p><p align=left>"What do you know about psionics?" I asked him.
</p><p align=left>"How do you think I teleport?" he replied.  "I'm not a
magician."
</p><p align=left>"I thought you were."
</p><p align=left>"Nope.  It's all mind over matter."
</p><p align=left>Hmm.  If Hezekiah's mind could win that kind of contest, it
substantially lowered my opinion of matter.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Miriam didn't know exactly what Rivi and the Fox were up to,
but they wanted to find something that was buried in the dust a
long time ago.  The mysterious object had been unearthed once
before, by an expedition under the leadership of Felice DeVail,
Guvner Oonah's mother.  The Fox had belonged to that expedition,
along with members of many other Sigil factions; they had toured
several planes including Dust, eventually jumping by accident
into the middle of the Gray Wastes and finding themselves trapped
between hostile armies in the Blood Wars raging there.
</p><p align=left>Most of the party had died in short order; the Fox had been
battered by evil magics, and driven insane; but a few, including
Felice, had escaped unscathed, dragging the Fox with them and
eventually making their way back to Sigil.  Naturally, the
survivors had all reported these events to their factions,
depositing personal accounts of the expedition in the various
faction archives.  Just as naturally, the Fox had set about
stealing those accounts from faction headquarters the moment Rivi
freed him.  His eagerness to return here suggested that the long-
ago expedition had found some kind of treasure in the Plane of
Dust but hadn't taken it with them.  Now, the Fox had come back
to collect that treasure, using the information he had stolen
from the factions.
</p><p align=left>Miriam's story introduced a dozen new puzzles about what was
going on, but such questions could wait.  At least we knew
something about our opposition now: fire-wizard Fox, psionic
Rivi, and an assortment of bashers from Sigil.  There was only
one other question in my mind, and I asked it.  "If Petrov and
his cronies captured some prisoners, where would he take them?"
</p><p align=left>"To Rivi," Miriam answered immediately.  "She can do things to
people's minds.  She can...change you.  Back when she and the Fox
were recruiting people, they hired two first-rate knights of the
post: sneak thieves.  Only problem was, the thieves wouldn't work
together--one was githyanki, the other githzerai.  Hated each
other like poison.  So Rivi took them away for a few hours, and
next thing you know, they're bosom buddies.  Lifelong friends.
She did something spooky to their brains."
</p><p align=left>"Is that really possible?" I whispered to Hezekiah.  It irked
me to turn to a Clueless for information, but he was the only
authority we had on psionic powers.
</p><p align=left>"Rearranging a person's thoughts can be tricky," he whispered
back.  "Making it permanent is even harder.  It once took Uncle
Toby a whole day to stop two kings from declaring war with each
other.  Of course, he had to fix up their generals too, so that's
what dragged out the time."
</p><p align=left>"Your Uncle...painted over their minds?"  I pictured how
easily I could change a frown to a smile with just a few strokes
of the brush.  Was it that easy for Uncle Toby?  Was it equally
easy for Rivi?  If this brainpainter had enough time to work on
Yasmin, to rape her mind...
</p><p align=left>"We have to save the others," I said.  "We have to save them
now."
</p><p align=left>"Where can we find this Rivi?" Wheezle asked quietly.
</p><p align=left>"Her quarters are on the lower level," Miriam replied.  "I can
show you."
</p><p align=left>I glanced at Wheezle, raising my eyebrows.  "We cannot trust
her," Wheezle said, answering my unasked question.  "On the other
hand, it is safer to take her with us than leave her or kill her.
As long as she remains in our hands, she has an incentive to
cooperate."  The little gnome turned to her.  "You understand
what these wights will do if you betray us?"
</p><p align=left>The wights leered in her face, but she just jutted out her
chin.  "I know the game," she answered.  "I'll play."
</p><p align=left>"And I'll make sure she does," Hezekiah said.  "I'll take her
under my wing."
</p><p align=left>He moved to her side and smiled.  Suddenly, he was terrifying
again--his face didn't change a muscle, but his smile took on the
unnatural brightness of a killer, the placid tranquility of a
child who could slay its mother without conscience.  In that face
was all the cruelty of childhood, the taunts, the bullying, the
inventive tortures of insects and younger siblings.
</p><p align=left>"You'll be good, won't you?" Hezekiah told Miriam.  Then he
was simply a Clueless boy again, his smile only a smile, his face
only an eighteen-year-old face.
</p><p align=left>I couldn't stand to look at it.
</p><p align=left>"Don't worry about me," Miriam mumbled.  "You're my high-up
man, you are."  She edged away from him but kept her head
lowered, like a dog showing submission to a wolf.
</p><p align=left>"Then we're all set," the boy said.  "Let's get going."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>With a pair of wights taking the lead, we proceeded down the
corridor.  Below us, in the circular arena surrounded by the ring
of the Glass Spider, other wights continued to wade through the
dust, searching for who-knew-what.  I wondered how big their
target was.  Something the size of a needle would take days to
find, but something substantial, like a spellbook or a magic
sword, would surely turn up soon; there was a lot of ground to
cover out there, but there were a lot of wights searching.
</p><p align=left>If we didn't rescue Yasmin and the others before the wights
found their objective, I knew we'd all be in big trouble.  No one
went to all this bother for something innocuous.
</p><p align=left>Soon, we were approaching the next intersection of a radial
arm with the Spider's central ring.  As before, a furniture-
filled lounge occupied the area where the arm connected with the
body; but in the center of the room was a spiral wrought-iron
staircase leading down to a lower level.  The iron was bare and
unpainted, yet I couldn't see the slightest fleck of rust--either
these steps were scoured daily by a platoon of wights with
sandpaper, or there was some kind of magic at work, maintaining
this place in pristine condition.  I put my money on the magic:
the whole Glass Spider was in good upkeep, but it had an air of
antiquity about it, as if it had endured for eons, impervious to
decay.
</p><p align=left>Miriam gestured that we should go down the stairs.  Wheezle
stopped her and sent two wights ahead to see if the way was
clear.  They came back smiling their pointy grins and hissing in
a relaxed fashion that suggested no one was lurking in ambush.
We formed up our company again, wights at the head and rear, more
wights tightly surrounding Miriam; then we began our descent.
</p><p align=left>As we climbed downward, my ears picked up a rumbling in the
distance.  It took me a few seconds to identify the sound; but
then I remembered a tour I had taken of The Lady's Chime, that
huge clock tower just down the street from Sigil's Hall of
Speakers.  The upper floors of the tower had echoed with the
clicking of gears, the whirr of flywheels, and the ratcheting of
counterweights pulling time forward.  The rumble I heard now had
the same sort of mechanical edge to it--a giant clockworks
muttering to itself.  We must be approaching the machinery that
allowed the Glass Spider to move.
</p><p align=left>A long arcing corridor led us away from the stairs, and soon
the air filled with the smell of metal: bare metal, oiled metal,
hot metal.  The corridor was lit by glass globes suspended from
the ceiling; each globe burned bright and white from some inner
fire.  Their light revealed that Hezekiah had linked his arm with
Miriam's as soon as we reached this lower floor.  Clearly, he
didn't want to risk her running away while he'd been appointed to
watch her.
</p><p align=left>The mechanical rumble grew louder as we continued forward.
Ahead lay an open doorway, and beyond that was a room full of
metal machinery: I recognized gears, chain-belts, cables, and
other simple trappings, but the great bulk of equipment was
beyond my comprehension.  How could one understand a bank of
square crystals glowing with hieroglyphs of light, or huge metal
drums that occasionally hissed steam through red-hot stopcocks?
What was the purpose of a dozen metal pistons pounding in and out
of smoking cylinders, or a gold stalactite mounted above a copper
stalagmite with squirts of lightning leaping between their
points?  All I knew was that the air burned and reeked with oil,
like the vestibule of some fiery hell.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle stopped us once more and turned a questioning gaze
toward Miriam.  "It's always like this," the woman shrugged.
"You're a gnome--you should know about machines."
</p><p align=left>"I specialize in death, not devices," Wheezle replied.  "Are
we close to where this Rivi would be?"
</p><p align=left>"Her quarters are in this machine room," Miriam said.  "She
likes it here."
</p><p align=left>"How can she sleep with all this noise?"
</p><p align=left>"She says it just takes discipline.  Rivi is hot blazing barmy
about discipline."
</p><p align=left>"Why doesn't that surprise me?" I muttered.  But Wheezle was
already leading us forward.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>A machine room full of moving parts is no place to go when
your nerves are on edge.  Gears clank; you whirl, expecting an
attack.  Steam erupts from a release valve; it leaves cloudy
films on nearby surfaces, looking like ghosts out the corner of
your eye.  Pistons bang and conveyor belts flap; so much motion,
so many nooks for enemies to hide.  Every second, there was
something new to jump at.
</p><p align=left>"There's a control room over in the corner," Miriam said above
the clatter of machinery.  "That's where Rivi spends most of her
time."
</p><p align=left>"Then you stay here with Hezekiah," I told her.  "Wheezle and
I will see if Rivi's home."
</p><p align=left>"Whack her the second you see her," Miriam advised.  "She'll
addle your chops if you don't."
</p><p align=left>"No loyalty toward your former boss?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"None," Miriam replied.  "If you don't put Rivi down, she'll
turn my brains to cheese for helping you."
</p><p align=left>"We shall try to avoid that eventuality," Wheezle said.
Kowtowing briefly to those who were staying behind, he gathered a
selection of wights and gestured for me to take the lead.
</p><p align=left>The control room in the corner had thick concrete walls
without a single window.  An odd design--if you were a worker
controlling the machinery, wouldn't it be nice to see what the
equipment was doing?  On the other hand, perhaps the room was not
a command post where you calmly watched gauges so much as a
bunker to take cover when you pushed the wrong button.
</p><p align=left>The door to the control room was closed.  I took one side of
it, Wheezle took the other, and the wights stood directly back
from the opening, ready to charge in as soon as I turned the
knob.  Holding up his fingers, Wheezle counted off Three, Two,
One.  Flick, I threw open the door, and with a clatter of toe-
claws across cement, the wights leapt forward.  I jumped in right
behind them, my rapier drawn and ready to impale anyone who could
paint obscenities over other people's brains.
</p><p align=left>There was nobody home.
</p><p align=left>Undoubtedly, however, someone did live in this room.  In the
back corner was a small cot, its crisp sheets tucked and folded
with a precision that would satisfy the most fastidious member of
the Harmonium.  Around the walls, wooden tables held neat stacks
of paper, numerous books alphabetized by title, and a few scrolls
hung on pine dowels.  The whole place had an air of obsessive
organization.
</p><p align=left>I turned my back on it.  "Rivi's not here."
</p><p align=left>"True," Wheezle nodded.  "But her library is.  It could teach
us a great deal about her intentions."
</p><p align=left>"It would take days to read all this, and that's assuming it's
written in a language we understand.  Let's keep moving."
</p><p align=left>"Surely we can spare a minute to glance at a page or two,"
Wheezle said.
</p><p align=left>I waved my arm at the collection.  "Which page?"
</p><p align=left>"The oldest."  He shuffled to the closest table and peered at
the stacks--paper, parchment, vellum, papyrus.  "The oldest," he
went on, "is most likely to tell of the beginning of things.
Obscure secrets.  Forgotten wisdom."  He moved to another table.
"I have studied a number of ancient languages and am quite fluent
in...ah, this looks interesting."
</p><p align=left>Standing on tiptoe, he pushed away a stack of papers to reveal
something underneath: a clay tablet, covered with scratchy marks
like the footprints of a mouse.  At some point in the past, the
tablet had broken into three flat pieces; later on, Rivi or
someone else had reassembled the pieces like parts of a puzzle,
imbedding them in newer clay to hold them together.  I had to
admit, it certainly looked like the oldest document in the room.
</p><p align=left>"Can you read it?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"I have seen the script before," Wheezle replied.  "The
language is called Urqlish--extremely old.  Some say it predates
the eldest gods.  No one knows how to pronounce its words, but my
mentors taught me how to decipher such writings.  The Urqs,
whoever they were, left massive volumes of text to posterity.
Much of it deals with incomprehensible facets of their culture,
but this...this is something different."
</p><p align=left>"What does it say?"
</p><p align=left>"Let me see.  The Words of Savant...I can't make out the
savant's name, but it doesn't matter.  The Words of Savant
whoever to his liege lord: Know, O Queen..."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Know, O Queen, that in the mists of the past, things were not
as they are today.  There was a time when the secrets of magic
were hidden from the seven races; indeed, some scholars say there
was a time before magic was born, when humans alone lived in a
fresh and simple world.
</p><p align=left>But the flower of magic blossomed in its time, and the simple
world yielded to a more complicated age.  Wizards seized great
power for themselves; and in the way of all souls, some used
their power for good while others used it for evil.  Often, rival
sorcerers waged terrible war on each other, devastating the land
and slaughtering innocents by the thousands.
</p><p align=left>At that time, our gods were not yet born.  Some sages claim
that the beings who walked the hidden places of the land were not
true gods at all: they were mere mortals, but able to command
engines of such puissance that our ancestors mistook them for
gods.  I do not know the truth of it, O Queen; but I can tell you
there were celestial powers of one type or another who watched
the havoc wrought by magicians and shook their heads in sorrow.
</p><p align=left>Some of these powers sought to curb the destruction by
creating sorcerers of their own: priests who would shape the
forces of magic in obedience to their patron's will.  Thus began
the practice of gods granting spells to the most devout of their
followers.
</p><p align=left>But some celestial powers believed that fighting magic with
magic was purest folly.  "Surely," these powers said, "the best
way to stop this madness is to stop magic itself."  For many
days, they debated how they could do this.  The flux of magic had
come to fill the multiverse, and no one was strong enough to
exhaust the supply.  At last, however, one group of powers, the
most exalted among their colleagues, devised a plan: if they
could not shut off the flux itself, they could at least prevent
lesser beings from sculpting the flux, so that humans and others
could no longer wield the stuff of sorcery.
</p><p align=left>Then gathered the greatest of those powers.  Their names are
forgotten; we know them only as the Warrior, the Poet, the Witch,
the Prayer, the Healer, the Scholar, and Death.  Using all the
knowledge at their command, they constructed a laughably simple
device--a grinder, such as a peasant might use to grind out
pepper or salt.  This grinder, however, ground out a never-ending
supply of sticky white dust.
</p><p align=left>Such a simple thing; and yet, the dust was not simple.  In the
presence of a concentration of magic, the dust fed on that magic
and grew as hot as molten steel--a magical heat so pure and
piercing it could burn the very fiends of the pit.  Now imagine,
O Queen, what might happen to your court mage if he had particles
of such dust on his clothes or skin.  As he began to cast a
spell, he would draw into himself the flux of magical energies,
concentrating it within his being...when suddenly, his skin would
sear with agony, his clothes catch fire!  Wracked with pain, he
could not complete the spell; or if he pressed on by sheer force
of will, he would continue to burn until he turned to ash.
</p><p align=left>This was the plan of the celestial powers--to grind out such
dust and spread it throughout the world...indeed, through all the
realms of the multiverse.  In every place, the dust would
disperse, settling on people, on plants and animals, on houses
and seas; and how could mages escape that dust?  It would settle
on their bodies, their clothes, their food, their drink...no
amount of washing could get every particle.
</p><p align=left>Armed with the grinder, its creators began to tour the Ten
Thousand Worlds.  Wherever they spread their dust, magicians
quickly ended their sorceries.  Of course, some sought to develop
spells to protect themselves from the dust; but how could they
cast such enchantments?  Even those who thought themselves
flameproof, who danced with fire and drank molten rock, found
themselves ravaged by the dust's awful heat.  Thus all sorcery
was suspended, and for a time, the Ten Thousand Worlds returned
to the simplicity of life without magic.  Most people, I believe,
breathed a sigh of relief.
</p><p align=left>But what of the other celestial powers...the ones who had
armed their priests with magicks of their own?  Those powers
raged in fury at the anti-magic dust; for the deities with magic-
wielding followers revelled in the influence exerted by their
priests, and without magic, the priests were mortals like anyone
else.  Congregations began to ask uncomfortable questions, the
most important being, "Do I truly want to worship this god?"
People may bow their heads to any deity if there are sufficient
rewards for devotion, or punishments for disobedience; but if the
rewards and punishments stop, congregations soon realize some
deities are less worthy of worship than others.
</p><p align=left>Great were the howls of wrath from celestial powers snubbed by
their flocks.  They raged against the creators of the grinder,
and banded together to declare a war of vengeance.  Long did the
battle thunder through the heavens.  The seven creators were the
greatest of the powers, but arrayed against them were so many
angered deities that at last the seven were defeated.  I cannot
tell you their fates, O Queen; some scholars say the creators
were obliterated, while others say they were torn apart but soon
re-formed to become the gods we revere today.
</p><p align=left>As for the grinder, the other celestial powers found they did
not have the strength to unmake it, or even to stop the
continuing flow of magic-killing dust.  Their solution was to
create a second grinder and a second type of dust: a brown dust
that draws and channels the magical flux away from the white
dust.  I have told you, O Queen, what would happen if your court
mage attempted to cast a spell with the white dust on his skin;
but if he also had brown dust it would act as a funnel, drawing
magic away from the white dust and directing it into your mage's
soul.  The white dust would not burn, and the magical flux would
be even more focussed than usual.
</p><p align=left>In fact, O Queen, your court mage and all things in all places
contain a few motes of both the white and brown dust.  The
creators of the first grinder spread its dust to all worlds; and
after those creators were defeated, the other powers spread equal
quantities of their own dust to counteract the first.  Once the
different dusts had come to balance, the two grinders were bound
together, like mundane salt and pepper shakers, and thrown into
an empty plane of existence.  There they have continued to grind,
even to this very day.  They have filled that plane with their
dust, from one horizon to the other, and they will persist in
their grinding to the end of time.
</p><p align=left>Or so the ancient tales say.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>When Wheezle finished reading, neither of us spoke for several
seconds.  Even the wights were silent, their burning gaze lost in
some unknown distance.
</p><p align=left>"Miriam told us Rivi hated magic," I said at last.
</p><p align=left>"Indeed," Wheezle nodded.  "And if she finds the two
grinders...one grinder makes it impossible for people to cast
magic, and the other is essentially the antidote.  An exceedingly
powerful pair of weapons."
</p><p align=left>"What would happen," I asked, "if she spread the white dust
over a battlefield?  While she and her allies were safely covered
in the brown."
</p><p align=left>"Magic decides many battles," Wheezle replied, "especially
when your opponents have none.  With proper tactics, Rivi could
become a fearsome conqueror."
</p><p align=left>"Of course," I said, "some god would eventually stop her.
Step in and seize the grinders."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle shook his head.  "I think if one god tried to possess
such powerful artifacts, other gods would prevent that from
happening.  Suppose, for example, that a good god claimed the
grinders; evil gods would fear such weapons wielded in the cause
of virtue, and would try to take the grinders for themselves.
The struggle might precipitate Ragnarok itself--the final battle
of god against god, wherein the cosmos is destroyed.  No,"
Wheezle said, "the gods will be extremely wary of
intervening...and if any god does, Rivi will be the least of the
multiverse's problems."
</p><p align=left>"But suppose Rivi tries to conquer Sigil!" I protested.
"Suppose she spreads her dust, then leads in an army equipped
with magic.  Surely The Lady of Pain would take direct action
then--it's her job to protect Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"The Lady of Pain may or may not be a god," Wheezle replied.
"She is Sigil's legendary protector, but she is also a great
mystery.  Perhaps she is only a sorcerer herself; in that case,
she will be as helpless as any streetcorner conjuror.  If by
chance she is a god...well, as I say, gods of all persuasions
would band together to prevent any other deity from claiming the
grinders.  Who knows the outcome?"
</p><p align=left>I shuddered.  Scant minutes ago, our party had just come to
rescue Yasmin and the others; now, it looked like the fate of
whole worlds was on the line.  Truth to tell, I still cared about
Yasmin more than some abstract threat toward Sigil or any other
realm...but the added pressure didn't help.

8. THREE SCORCHED PRISONERS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left></p><p align=left>n=left></p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Somberly, Wheezle and I left the control bunker, emerging once
more into the full din of the machinery room.  My Dustman
colleague had stuffed his pockets with scrolls and documents,
including the diary of Felice DeVail.  Perhaps we didn't have
time to read any more right now, but he fully intended to check
through everything when he got the chance.
</p><p align=left>The wights greeted us with spike-toothed smiles, but Hezekiah
and Miriam didn't notice us at first--they were too busy talking,
or rather yelling into each other's ears so they could be heard
above the clang of pistons.  Even with them shouting, I couldn't
make out what they were saying from any distance away; and as we
approached, Hezekiah saw us and guiltily broke off his
conversation.
</p><p align=left>I didn't like the look of that.  Miriam was scarcely an
irresistible seductress, but how much voluptuous charm would it
take to turn the Clueless boy's head?  She could never talk him
into knifing Wheezle or me in the back--he was too naively
virtuous for that--yet I worried he might help her "just a
little" and get us into trouble just a lot.
</p><p align=left>"Remember she's the enemy," I told him, shouting loudly
myself.  "She's untrustworthy and dangerous."
</p><p align=left>"She says I'm dangerous too," he replied.  "The way I scared
her makes her want to...she says she'd like to serve me."
</p><p align=left>That made me blink in surprise--I hadn't expected her taking
the submissive approach.  When Hezekiah made himself the
embodiment of terror, did he touch a responsive chord in Miriam's
heart?  Some people love to be overwhelmed, I knew that...and
when I glanced at Miriam, I saw her gazing at the boy with an
expression that was almost worshipful.  Of course, it was quite
probably a sham: just a different sham than I'd anticipated.  "Be
careful," I muttered to the boy, then turned away, embarrassed.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>

</p><p align=left>Within a minute, we had left behind the clamor of ratchets and
throttles and gears.  It hadn't been an interesting noise
anyway--lots of volume but no finesse.
</p><p align=left>"Where are you leading us now?" I asked Miriam.
</p><p align=left>"Petrov's quarters are just up ahead," she answered.  "You
said he might have helped capture your friends.  If he's in his
room, you can ask him yourself."
</p><p align=left>"Looking forward to it," I assured her as I drew my rapier
from its sheath.  Even if she was leading us into a trap, I'd be
happy to face Petrov with sword in hand.
</p><p align=left>The corridor opened into a sizable chamber with at least
twenty bunk beds set into the walls, like the recessed niches of
a mausoleum.  In the middle of the room stood a few metal tables
bolted to the floor, the sort of tables you might see in an army
barracks, where the soldiers sit, play cards, and boast of their
sexual exploits.  These tables, however, were too brightly
polished for a real barracks, with nary a stain from spilled
beer, nor scratches from mugs slammed down in anger when
someone's poker hand held one ace too many.  The rest of the room
also lacked any of the normal signs of occupation: the lingering
smells of bodies, the scuff marks of boots on the floor.
</p><p align=left>"Remarkably tidy for a hide-out," I said to Miriam.  "Is this
really where your cronies live?"
</p><p align=left>"Don't be a leatherhead," she growled.  "We underlings live
farther down the hall.  Mr. High-and-Mighty Petrov couldn't bear
to tuck down with the likes of us, so he moved into this empty
room.  He tried to tell us Rivi wanted him close in case she got
cold in the night...but that slag has so much ice in her veins,
she couldn't warm up if she kissed a red dragon."
</p><p align=left>"Uncle Toby once gave a sponge bath to a dragon," Hezekiah
piped up.  "I don't know what color it was."
</p><p align=left>"Hush," I told him.
</p><p align=left>"No, really, this is an interesting story.  The dragon had
contracted a case of mummy rot from some adventurer she'd eaten,
and Uncle Toby--"
</p><p align=left>I put a finger to his lips.  "Button it," I whispered.
"Someone's coming."
</p><p align=left>Chalk up another for a Sensate's razor-sharp hearing.  Some
distance ahead of us, a stream of grunts and groans echoed down
the corridor, punctuated now and then by a juicy upswell of
profanity.  Wheezle gestured and immediately one of the wights
wrapped its rotting hand over Miriam's mouth, just in case she
tried to shout a warning.  She tossed Wheezle an aggrieved look,
as if the thought would never enter her mind...but even if she
yelled her head off, the man approaching us probably wouldn't
have heard.  He seemed too caught up in venting his piteous moans
to notice any of the world around him.
</p><p align=left>Thirty seconds later, he walked into what he thought was an
empty room.  The bleached white hair showed it was our old friend
Petrov...but a Petrov who had clearly seen action since the
showdown on the Vertical Sea.  His head sported a blood-soaked
bandage, and his bare chest had turned a bright lobster red.
Under other circumstances, I might have believed his skin was
sunburned; but I knew this particular damage was frostbite,
courtesy of the blistering cold from Oonah DeVail's staff.
</p><p align=left>It made me smile that Petrov hadn't walked away from the fight
unscathed.  Unfortunately, the fact that he was walking at all
suggested his side had won in the end.  If Yasmin had come out on
top, Petrov would even now be dining on dust outside the Spider.
</p><p align=left>Like a mountain of misery, the big basher shuffled to one of
the tables and sat down with a heavy thud, letting his head slump
forward into his hands.  In all the time it took for him to get
into the room, he had never spared a glance into any of the
recessed bunks...which means he didn't notice eight wights and
assorted breathers lying there in wait.  His first clue that he
wasn't alone must have been the tip of my rapier pricking the
back of his neck.
</p><p align=left>"Greetings, honored hoodlum," Wheezle whispered in Petrov's
ear.  "We would not hurt you for the world, but you have
accidentally sat where Mr. Cavendish is about to thrust his
sword.  I suggest you keep very, very still."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Wheezle assigned four wights to hold Petrov down, a number
which struck me as excessive.  True, old Bleach-Hair was a bulky
brawler of a berk, and on a good night he could sling a pair of
tavern wenches under each arm; but at the moment, a five-year-old
with sharp fingernails could drop Petrov to his knees by poking
the man's frostbitten tum-tum.
</p><p align=left>"Should he really be moaning like that?" Hezekiah asked.  "I
think he's hurt."
</p><p align=left>"He wants us to let down our guard," I said, as the wights
slammed our captive onto the hard metal table.  The jarring sound
of impact was quickly replaced by a wail of agony from Petrov.
"He's such a big baby," I muttered.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle clambered up on a chair so he could lift himself to
eye level with the man.  "Now, honored hoodlum," he said, "we
would like to know what happened to our colleagues: the ones you
confronted back at the Vertical Sea."
</p><p align=left>"The sodding berks froze my hide off!" he growled.  "But I got
my revenge--showed them what a haunch of beef feels like inside
the oven."
</p><p align=left>I let the tip of my rapier nestle down against his Adam's
apple.  "Did you kill them?"
</p><p align=left>"I piking well wanted to...but Qi and Chi said no, Rivi would
want to question them."
</p><p align=left>"So all three are alive?"
</p><p align=left>"They were the last time I saw them.  Not pretty," he added
with a leer, "but alive."
</p><p align=left>With miniscule effort, I could have leaned forward and sent
the bladepoint through his windpipe.  Not pretty, but alive...the
words flooded like poison into my heart.  Petrov and his cronies
had been carrying firewands as they fought our friends.  I
thought of Yasmin looking as savagely burnt as the victims in the
court rotunda; and I had to walk away quickly before I forgot
myself.
</p><p align=left>"Who are Qi and Chi?" I heard Hezekiah asking.
</p><p align=left>"Thieves.  A githzerai and githyanki--they helped bring down
your pus-swilling friends.  While the boys and I made things
toasty up front, Qi and Chi snuck up from behind and tickled some
spines with steel.  Your group surrendered nice and quiet once
they'd been ventilated a bit."
</p><p align=left>"Where are our teammates now?" Wheezle asked.
</p><p align=left>"Go pike yourself."  Petrov aimed some spittle in Wheezle's
general direction.  He got more on himself than he did on the
gnome, but it was the thought that counted.  "I've said enough
already," Petrov snarled, "and I'm not rattling my bone-box no
more."
</p><p align=left>"Dear, oh dear," I tsked from the corner of the room, "torture
time again.  Hezekiah," I raised my voice, "what faction do you
think boasts the most fearsome torturers?"
</p><p align=left>"Ummm...the Mercykillers?"
</p><p align=left>"Not a bad guess," I told him.  "The Mercykillers like
torturing people and they put a lot of effort into it...but alas,
they're overly crude.  They're too fond of breaking bones and
spilling blood; they haven't devoted themselves to discovering
what genuinely causes the maximum amount of pain.  The true
students of excruciation are...well, I blush to admit it, but the
most adept torturers in the multiverse belong to my own faction,
the Sensates."
</p><p align=left>"You're a Sensate?" Petrov asked uneasily.
</p><p align=left>"That's right," I answered, stepping up to the table.  "We've
spent centuries documenting every possible sensation the human
body can experience.  Many people think we only pursue pleasure,
but that's wrong.  We devote equal time to the study of pain.  To
the science of pain.  For example, let me try to remember the
location of the capitus nerve."
</p><p align=left>I leaned over Petrov's body and drew out my tweak-knife.  It
was not an imposing blade, just a tiny thing I kept for whittling
pen nibs when I wanted to sketch in ink; but it had a good sharp
edge that I'd whetted less than a week earlier.  In a pinch, it
could double as a razor.
</p><p align=left>"The capitus nerve," I said, making up the story as I went
along, "runs all the way from the ball of the right foot to the
left lobe of the brain."  I drew the unsharpened side of the
blade up the length of Petrov's body.  "Did you know that the
longer the nerve is, the more pain it can experience?  And the
capitus nerve is the longest nerve in the body."
</p><p align=left>"Who the sod cares?" Petrov snapped.
</p><p align=left>"I, for one, find it most stimulating," Wheezle replied.
"Please continue, honored Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>"The capitus nerve runs through the most pain-sensitive areas
of the anatomy.  The knee.  The inside of the thigh.  The groin,
of course."  I tapped each of these lightly with the flat of the
blade.  "Then there's the chest, which I notice is already in a
tender condition.  There's a great deal of individual variation
in the route of the capitus through the chest, but you can
usually find it by cross-correlating with a few other key
meridians.  First you find the small intestine..."
</p><p align=left>I jabbed my thumb deep into the pit of Petrov's stomach.  He
shrieked, probably thinking I was using the knife; or maybe he
was reacting to true agony, from the frostbitten skin of his gut.
"Ohh," I said with great sympathy, "if you think that hurt,
you're in trouble.  The nerve I just hit was an itty-bitty
one...scarcely able to feel pain at all.  About the same size as
this one."
</p><p align=left>Extending a knuckle, I rubbed briskly along the man's sternum,
raking back and forth across a knot of nerves I happened to know
lurked there just under the skin.  Petrov howled again.  I wiped
off my knuckle; flakes of chapped skin had stuck to it when it
pulled away from Petrov's breastbone.
</p><p align=left>"Well, those two points of reference have given me a bearing
on where the capitus nerve should be," I told him.  Lifting my
knife, I added, "It may take some digging to hit the nerve bang-
on, but I guarantee it will be worth the wait."  I leaned in
toward one of the wights who was holding Petrov down.  "Could you
tilt his head so it's pointing away from me?  They always vomit
when I do this, and I don't have a change of clothes."
</p><p align=left>"All right!" Petrov yelled.  "Who the pike cares?  I'll take
you where the rotten sods are locked up."
</p><p align=left>A few seconds ticked away in silence; then Wheezle touched my
sleeve.  "Could you show me where the capitus nerve is anyway?  I
would be most interested in learning."
</p><p align=left>Wordlessly, I shook my head.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>More corridors to slog through, and time was ticking by.  I
wondered how long it would be till Rivi's wights found the
grinders out in the arena of dust.  There was no way to guess.
If I were a true hero like my father, maybe I'd be racing after
Rivi and the Fox instead of Yasmin: putting the fate of the
multiverse ahead of a few individuals.  We had Unveiler and could
command the wights to attack our enemies.  Unfortunately, the
wights would all be wandering in the airless arena, where they
couldn't hear us calling orders; meanwhile, we'd face a fire-mage
and a mind-raper, plus their band of bully-bashers armed with
flame-wands.
</p><p align=left>No, I decided, my father might have succeeded against such a
mass of enemies, but I couldn't handle the odds.  Saving Yasmin
and the others was at least manageable.  Once we rescued our
friends, we could hightail it back to Sigil and fetch
reinforcements.  It wasn't a heroic plan, but it was something we
might survive.
</p><p align=left>In time, I heard telltale sounds of clanking up ahead and
Petrov led us into another machinery room, twin to the previous
one.  Obviously, the Glass Spider had several independent drive
mechanisms, each with its own engine room; a separate motor for
each of the Spider's legs.  This machine room had the same number
of pistons chugging away, the same layout, the same noise...but
the control bunker in the corner had a huge wooden beam blocking
the door shut.
</p><p align=left>"They're in there," Petrov pointed to the door.  "Gods rot you
all."
</p><p align=left>"Amen," Wheezle agreed earnestly.
</p><p align=left>Three wights held Petrov, one held Miriam, and the other four
went to work moving the beam.  Judging from the way they
strained, I estimated the timber weighed close to a ton.  It took
the wights a full minute to get the beam clear of the door, and
in that time Hezekiah made a discovery: Oonah's ice-staff, tucked
in under a desk whose surface glowed with incomprehensible runes
of light.
</p><p align=left>"Rivi threw it there," Petrov said grudgingly, as Hezekiah
dragged the staff out.  "Wouldn't let anyone else touch it
because it was magic.  She hates magic and every damned sorcerer
in creation."
</p><p align=left>"Doesn't that make the Fox nervous?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"The Fox hasn't got enough brains to be nervous," Petrov
answered.  "He's too sodding barmy to see Rivi's just using him."
</p><p align=left>"Using him for what?"
</p><p align=left>But Petrov clamped his jaw tight and wouldn't say another
word.  I didn't press the issue--once we got old Bleach-Hair back
to Sigil, the Harmonium could sweat everything out of him.
</p><p align=left>The wights dragged away the beam at last, and Hezekiah leapt
forward to open the door.  I dashed after him, grabbed him by the
scruff of the neck, and barely managed to drag him back in
time...because the second the blockage was gone, the door burst
open with the force of a cannonball and Kiripao hit the floor in
a diving roll.  His momentum carried him up to his feet in one
fluid motion, and he had embedded his fist through the ribcage of
the nearest wight before he realized we were the good guys.
</p><p align=left>The wight, in life a female elf, glared pointedly down at
Kiripao's hand plunged wrist-deep into her chest.  Kiripao
blinked for a few moments, then got the message.  "Sorry," he
muttered, and levered the hand out of her thoracic cavity,
dragging with it some stray bone fragments and a spill of the red
powder that seemed to serve these wights as blood.
</p><p align=left>"Could I smell your hand?" I whispered to him.
</p><p align=left>"No."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Kiripao's robes had been reduced to charred rags during the
fire-fight.  He'd rearranged the remaining scraps into a passable
loincloth, leaving his chest and legs bare.  The flesh thus
revealed was a three-colored patchwork: the angry red of burns,
the pale pink of an elf's normal skin, and a milky white as
unblemished as a freshly gessoed canvas.  I'd seen that white
before, and not just on blank canvases--it was new skin, recently
regenerated by a powerful influx of healing magic.  Over the next
few hours, it would gradually adjust itself to match the rest of
Kiripao's body; in the meantime however, it showed that the pious
brother had taken quite a beating, and someone had patched him up
afterward.
</p><p align=left>Of course, I told myself, Kiripao must be in good standing
with his god.  If he prayed for his injuries to heal, the deity
would answer his prayers.  And he could have patched up Yasmin
and Oonah too in the same way...at least to the point where they
were out of immediate danger.
</p><p align=left>Oonah hobbled from the control room a moment later, working up
a warm smile when she saw this was a rescue party.  Whatever
healing she had received, it wasn't enough--her legs moved
stiffly, as if each step brought her fierce pain.  Her arms had
the same stiffness as she reached to take back her ice-staff from
Hezekiah; but once she grasped the staff in her hands, some of
her constriction appeared to ease.  I wondered if the staff had
inherent healing powers, or if she simply felt better holding it.
With reverent care, she set the butt of the staff onto the
ground, then leaned her weight wearily upon it.
</p><p align=left>Several more seconds passed; I held my breath, waiting for
Yasmin to emerge from the control room.  Kiripao and Oonah said
nothing.  When I could bear it no longer, I rushed to the doorway
and plunged inside.
</p><p align=left>When you're a Handmaid of Entropy, it seems you don't respond
well to healing.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin sat propped against the far wall of the control room,
her head sagging, her hands lying limply in her lap.  For a
moment, I didn't know if she was even alive; but then her chest
lifted with a soft and shallow breath.
</p><p align=left>In a heartbeat I was crouching by her side, but reluctant to
touch her for fear of causing pain.  Her dragon-skin sheath had
not been damaged by the firewands, but where the sheath hadn't
offered any defense--her arms, her bare shoulders--Yasmin's flesh
was deeply singed.  Her hair had burned down to the scalp.  Even
worse, there was a patch of wet stickiness on her back, just
below one shoulder blade.  I guessed that Qi or Chi must have
dirked her with a magic dagger, strong enough to pierce the tough
dragon hide that was supposed to protect her.
</p><p align=left>With a tortured moan, Yasmin lifted her head to look at me.
Her cheeks glistened with tears, squeezed out by the pain against
her will.  In a sighing whisper, she said, "You'll have to...draw
another sketch of me, Britlin.  The other one..."
</p><p align=left>She looked down at her hand and moved the fingers slightly.
Flakes of burnt paper fluttered into her lap.
</p><p align=left>"What can I do to help?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Not much," Oonah said from behind my back.  "She's resistant
to healing magic--all the Doomguard are."
</p><p align=left>"I tried my best," Kiripao added, "but her will fought back
too strongly."
</p><p align=left>"Entropy...must not be cheated," Yasmin whispered.  "A
Handmaid...must stay...loyal..."
</p><p align=left>Her voice drifted off.  At first, I thought she was simply too
tired to continue speech; but her eyes had focused on something
at the far end of the room, and I turned to see the others
entering the control room in the company of the wights.
</p><p align=left>"Wights..." she murmured.
</p><p align=left>"Don't worry," I assured her, "they're on our side."
</p><p align=left>"But they are...they have..."
</p><p align=left>A flicker of life pierced through her dull resignation; I had
no idea why.  "Yasmin, don't get yourself excited-- save your
strength."
</p><p align=left>"But the wights," she forced herself to speak.  "They
could...contribute..."
</p><p align=left>She was too weak to finish her sentence, but Wheezle hurried
forward.  "As a Dustman, I am familiar with the devotions of
Entropy, though I am not a follower myself.  Handmaids disapprove
of conventional curative magics, but they practice a different
form of healing that adheres to the precepts of their faith.  I
believe they can simply...withdraw health from one body and
transfer it to someone else."
</p><p align=left>"Not all of the health is transferred," Yasmin whispered.
"Some life energy is simply...dissipated...in the process.
Praise Entropy."
</p><p align=left>Immediately, I offered, "If she wants a life infusion, she can
have some from me."
</p><p align=left>"No," Yasmin said, putting great force into that single word.
"The wights..."
</p><p align=left>"She is correct," Wheezle nodded.  "Once health begins to
drain from one body to another, the flow is next to impossible to
stop.  Better to take the energy from the wights, honored
Cavendish.  It will lay them cleanly to rest, just as Unveiler
would; and it is an obviously noble cause."
</p><p align=left>"Noble!" Petrov snorted.  "Pardon me while I puke."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah calmly threw a backfist into Petrov's gut.  The man
doubled over, stopped from falling only by the wights who held
his arms.
</p><p align=left>"Not bad," said Kiripao, "but try for more snap in your
wrist."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Wheezle asked for four volunteers from the wights.  All of
them stepped forward, including the ones holding Petrov and
Miriam.  I wondered if they were simply eager to please the
person who held the scepter, or if some measure of generosity
still lurked behind those flaming eyes.  Perhaps all undead
possessed a degree of good will as well as bad; they merely
walked down wicked paths because their creators were almost
always evil.
</p><p align=left>For the sake of simplicity, Wheezle chose the four wights who
didn't have their hands full with our prisoners.  The first was
an orc woman with greasy black hair and a more than usually
greenish complexion.  She settled gently onto her knees beside
Yasmin and actually managed a smile (despite her boar-like
tusks).  Then the wight hissed softly and held out her hand for
Yasmin to take.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's lips moved in silent invocation.  I found it
difficult to picture an impersonal force like Entropy being able
to confer favors on its faithful...but how different was this
from the practices of druids?  Druids didn't worship any
particular deity, they attuned themselves to Nature itself; in
time, that attunement let them draw upon the power of Nature to
perform magical deeds.  Thinking about it, I had to admit the
downhill force of Entropy was just as strong, if not stronger,
than the vitality surging through plants and animals.  If you
attuned yourself to Entropy, why couldn't you learn to channel
that strength?
</p><p align=left>Even as I watched, the channeling began.  Yasmin used her last
reserves of willpower to reach out and take the wight's offered
hand.  Weakly, she pulled it in toward her body, pressing it
against her stomach.  "Do you give willingly?" she asked the
wight.
</p><p align=left>It nodded.
</p><p align=left>For a long moment, nothing discernible happened.  Then the
wight's lips pursed into a tiny O, and its eyes opened wide.  It
let out a tiny trickle of sound, a small astonished breath; the
noise made me think of a woman in passion, touched by her lover
and finding herself swept with a deep surprising heat.  The wight
reached out with its other hand, taking Yasmin by the arm and
holding tight, its talons digging into Yasmin's flesh.  I
shuddered for a moment as I remembered the wight behind the
Mortuary, clawing its victim and withering her arm...but in the
blink of an eye, it was the wight who began to wither.
</p><p align=left>The orc woman's hair went first.  It fell, strand by strand,
onto the rotting garment that covered the wight's shoulders.
Then her skin puckered, wrinkling, cracking, flaking away.
Underneath, her muscles were taut bands of filaments stretched
over bone; but as the seconds ticked by, the tautness eased and
the filaments separated from one another, like threads slipped
off a loom, one by one.
</p><p align=left>Layer by layer, the wight's body fell away, sloughed off like
unneeded clothes.  Nothing decayed entirely--all the pieces
remained.  It was only the life energy that seeped off, drained
from each fiber of flesh...and once the life was gone, the stray
bits of anatomy had no remaining cohesion.  The pieces separated
quietly, like strangers who had no reason to stay together.
</p><p align=left>Despite the power flooding out of the wight, I could see
little improvement in Yasmin.  Perhaps the worst of her burns
looked a little glossier, covered with an almost invisible veneer
of regenerated skin; and perhaps the blood had stopped welling
quite so quickly from the knife wound in her back.  Even so, her
eyes retained a deathly dullness and her hands showed only
fatigue as they clung to the crumbling wight.  Entropy might be
allotting Yasmin a tiny portion of the wight's lifeforce...but it
was keeping the lion's share for itself.
</p><p align=left>Soon, the wight had devolved to nothing but a meatless
skeleton.  One hand still pressed against Yasmin's stomach, and
the other held her arm in its claws; but with a click of bones,
it released its taloned grip and lifted its fingers to cup Yasmin
under the chin.  The gesture was exquisitely tender, like a
mother reassuring her child...and then the skeleton peacefully
relaxed into a litter of unconnected bones, their fall to the
floor muffled by the dry pillow of tissues that had slumped off
first.
</p><p align=left>"More," Yasmin whispered hungrily.  And the next wight stepped
up, its face composed in total serenity.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Three more wights.  Three more subdued collapses.  I think
Yasmin could have absorbed the energy of a dozen such donors and
still longed for more; but the four who sacrificed themselves
were enough to repair the most grievous damage.  The stab wound
under her shoulder blade was closed and clean.  The patches of
charred flesh on her arms and shoulders had now coated over with
milk white, as smooth as the cataract in an old dwarf's eye.
There was even a dark fuzz of hair covering her scalp, like red-
brown lichen on a stone--not a fashionable coiffure, but my
fingers longed to touch that close-shaven beauty.
</p><p align=left>"Hello," she said, a sparkle in her eyes at last.  "Hello,"
she said again, looking directly at me.  "Hello.  Hello.  Hello."
</p><p align=left>"Can I help you up?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Please."
</p><p align=left>She reached out both arms, like a child eager for her father
to lift her.  I had to use one foot to sweep away the remains of
wights surrounding her; then I raised her gently, wrapping my
arms around her as delicately as I could, no matter how fiercely
I longed to enfold her with my full strength.  Yasmin had no such
reserve--as she rose to her feet, her arms encircled me and
pulled me close, squeezing as if she wanted to completely embed
her face in my chest.  I returned the embrace, clasping her as
tightly as I dared and aware of nothing else in the world but the
woman I held.
</p><p align=left>"Honored Cavendish, Honored Handmaid," murmured Wheezle as he
plucked at the hem of my jacket.  "We must go now.  There is so
little time."
</p><p align=left>"There is no time," said a new voice.  And suddenly the room
was filled with a blinding cloud of fine white dust.
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="9"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
9. THREE DUSTY COMBUSTIONS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Blinded by the dust, I couldn't see for the next few seconds.
Kiripao must have tried something, because I heard him utter a
cry of attack; but he was answered with a thunderous boom, and he
made no other sound.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin, still in my arms, whispered, "Didn't you have someone
watching our backs?"
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah was out there," I replied.  "The Clueless little
berk..."
</p><p align=left>"He's hurt," said Oonah, somewhere in the cloud.
</p><p align=left>Gradually, the dust settled around us.  Every face around me
was powdered white; every stick of furniture, every scrap of
clothing was clotted with the same white silt.  The door to the
control room had shut tight--the boom I heard must have been the
door slamming.  Kiripao was straining to push it open, but
without success.
</p><p align=left>Oonah knelt a short distance from the door, bending over the
motionless body of Hezekiah.  I could see no wounds on the boy;
and as Oonah gave his shoulder a shake, he groaned and rolled
over on his back.
</p><p align=left>"What happened, Kid?" Miriam asked.  Her voice was
surprisingly full of concern.
</p><p align=left>"Someone blanked me," the boy muttered.  "Shut me down."  He
slammed his fist against the floor.  "I hate that."
</p><p align=left>"But you're all right now?" Miriam insisted.
</p><p align=left>"I'll live," he said.  "But...I'm a bit scrambled at the
moment.  I won't be able to teleport for hours."
</p><p align=left>"Don't trouble yourself," Oonah told him.  She raised her
staff and pointed its silver-wire tip toward the door.  "Now that
I'm properly armed, this little cage won't hold us for..."
</p><p align=left>"Don't!" Wheezle and I shouted in unison.
</p><p align=left>"Why not?" she snapped.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle shuffled forward, dust dribbling off his ears like
flour.  "Alas, honored Guvner, this dust is dangerous...at least
if you invoke magic.  We must exercise extreme caution."
</p><p align=left>"What a shame," echoed an unfamiliar female voice.  "I hoped
you wouldn't know what the dust did.  It would have been ever so
interesting to see what happened."
</p><p align=left>The walls of the control room looked like concrete, coated
with the chalky powder that covered us all; suddenly, however,
the cement-like material turned as clear as glass, offering us a
dust-smeared view of the machine room outside.  No wonder this
control room didn't have any windows: the walls themselves could
become windows, and obviously someone outside knew the secret of
making that happen.  Quickly, I swept a hand across the wall
closest to me, cleaning away enough of the dust to see through
clearly.
</p><p align=left>A gang of eight wights stood back five paces from the wall,
their faces nearly as dusty as mine and ten times as ugly.  All
of them were huge bashers, their shoulders wide, their claws the
size of pine cones.  I saw no hint of friendliness in the
expressions of these undead; hate blazed in their eyes.  Perhaps
the hate was inspired by the people who stood in front of the
monsters--two humans who could only be Rivi and the Fox.
</p><p align=left>I'd seen men like the Fox many times before: grizzled old sods
with streaky gray hair and five days of stubble on their faces.
This particular example wore an ecstatic leer of madness, and his
gaze never stopped swooping about the room, as if he were
surrounded by wonders mere mortals could not see.  Poor old
barmy: his type wandered the streets of Sigil daily, begging for
handouts or talking wildly to themselves until they were taken in
by the Bleak Cabal and given a bed in the Gatehouse asylum.
</p><p align=left>Rivi was much more extraordinary.  To say she was an albino
would not do justice, either to Rivi or to albinos in general.
She had the telltale white hair and eyebrows, the unpigmented
skin and the pale pink eyes; but she had decided to paint
herself, to apply make-up and dyes in a controlled chaos that
only emphasized her pallor.  Red eyeshadow made her eyes look
like blood-filled sinkholes in her face.  The merest touch of
blue on her cheeks gave her the icy look of a corpse who has lain
overnight in the snow.  Her long white hair was streaked with
bands of red and green, which would look cheerfully festive on
some women; on Rivi, however, the effect was harshly lunatic, as
if nightmares had bled from her skull and contaminated her scalp.
</p><p align=left>She wore a gown of clinging black silk, sheer enough to betray
the stark whiteness of her body beneath; and like many venomous
women, Rivi had the body of a goddess, maintained as carefully as
a champion fencer might hone her sword.  I could scarcely take my
eyes off the play of black silk over white flesh, taut fabric
stretching over tauter curves.  Some sages claim that the powers
of evil take delight in bestowing such visceral allure on the
most corrupt of souls...and although I have known many beauties
with no great darkness in their hearts, I have met a handful like
Rivi, demons sporting the voluptuousness of an angel.
</p><p align=left>Rivi smiled at me now with the triumph of a viper watching its
victim die.  "Hello, darlings!" she cooed.  "What lovely subjects
for my experiments!  No sooner do I find my wee trinket than you
give me a chance to use it."
</p><p align=left>She held up the "wee trinket"...an artifact of terrifying
power disguised as a harmless salt grinder, a small white
container with a winding arm on top.  Trickles of pale dust
spilled out the bottom.  "The crank controls the flow," Rivi
said, holding the grinder up higher.  "Anything from a light
shower like this to that cloud that coated you all.  Think what
it can do against those precious wee schemers who use magic in
Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"The Lady of Pain will stop you," Oonah snapped.  "She'll seal
every portal against you."
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps," Rivi admitted.  "But a little bird told me there
are some things too powerful for The Lady to stop.  This coy wee
grinder is one of the most potent relics in the multiverse; it
will be such lovely fun to compare its strength to hers.  And
even if I'm barred from Sigil...oh, the planes offer a world of
opportunities for a woman who can stop magic in its self-
important wee tracks."
</p><p align=left>"Who can stop enemy magic," the Fox put in, speaking for the
first time.  "The people on our side don't have to worry."
</p><p align=left>He lifted a trinket of his own, a twin to the grinder Rivi
held, except this one was tan in color.  Holding it over his
head, he flicked the crank with one finger, and a deluge of brown
dust cascaded down on top of him.  "See?" he asked, his gleeful
eyes blinking under a cake of dust, "I'm magic and you're not.
Hah!"
</p><p align=left>"Don't play, darling," Rivi said, taking the brown grinder
from him.  "It'll make the other children jealous."
</p><p align=left>"I'll show you jealous," Oonah muttered, raising her staff.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle put a gentle hand on her arm.  "Let me try first,
honored Guvner."  He moved to the patch of wall I had wiped free
of dust and pressed his face to its glass-like surface.  His gaze
slipped slyly toward the Fox and Rivi, then fixed on the gang of
wights.  Suddenly he snapped Unveiler up into sight and shouted,
"I command you--"
</p><p align=left>He never finished his sentence.  The dust-covered scepter
erupted with searing incandescence, so hot that a blast of
scorching air hit my face like an invisible punch.  Wheezle, much
closer to the expulsion of energy, was thrown off his feet and
propelled shrieking backward toward the opposite side of the
room.  He smashed against the wall and slid downward, coils of
smoke curling from the hand that had held the scepter.
</p><p align=left>Unveiler itself, still blazing white-hot, tumbled to the
floor.  Normal metal would have melted to lava...but then, the
Dustmen had done their best to destroy the scepter without
noticeable success, so why should a little heat make a
difference?
</p><p align=left>"I don't understand," Hezekiah cried.  "What happened?"
</p><p align=left>"The white dust burns if you try to focus magical energy," I
replied.
</p><p align=left>"But Wheezle didn't use any magic," the boy protested.  "He
was only talking to the wights."
</p><p align=left>"Unveiler uses magic to control the undead," I told him.  "As
soon as Wheezle tried to issue a command...."
</p><p align=left>"Wights!" Wheezle groaned, not trying to get up.  "Listen to
me, honored wights...I am still your master."
</p><p align=left>He was answered with an agitated shuffling of feet.  Both
inside and outside our room, the wights seemed confused and
anxious.  Perhaps they wanted to obey Wheezle, but he was no
longer holding the scepter; that left them leaderless and adrift.
Would they attack us indiscriminately now, filled with the
customary hatred of the undead for the living?  Or would they
simply wander away like disoriented children, eventually
stumbling out into the infinite dust?
</p><p align=left>"I can't tell you how this irks me," Rivi murmured, glaring
hungrily at the fallen scepter.  "Petrov...dear Petrov...pick up
that wee bauble, please, before it gets dirty."
</p><p align=left>Petrov, on our side of the transparent wall, stared at Rivi in
disbelief.  "You're barmy!" he told her.  "It'd burn my sodding
hand off."
</p><p align=left>Rivi's eyes narrowed.  "Darling--I said, pick it up!"
</p><p align=left>For several long moments, nothing happened.  Petrov wasn't
held tightly by wights anymore; they were blinking stupidly,
trying to decide what to do.  Our friend Bleach-Hair struggled
free of their limp grasp and looked desperately around the
room...maybe searching for a hiding place, hoping he could escape
Rivi's reach.
</p><p align=left>Her eyes continued to bore into him, as sharp as stilettos;
and at last, as if an invisible giant had him in its grip, Petrov
turned to face the woman.  Immediately, he tried to look away
again.  He couldn't.  I don't think he could even close his
eyes--as he shuddered under her gaze, flecks of dust shook free
from his hair, wafted downward, and settled on his bare eyeball.
Petrov didn't react...but prickles of sweat beaded up on his face
as Rivi's eyes continued to pierce his mind.
</p><p align=left>"Please," he whispered.  "Please don't."
</p><p align=left>Rivi answered with a calm smile.  "Pick up the wee scepter,
darling.  You've been a bad boy, leading these people around our
stronghold...but I'll forgive you with my soft girlish heart if
you do me this kind wee favor."
</p><p align=left>Petrov took a jerky step toward Unveiler.  At the top of his
lungs, he screamed, "No!"
</p><p align=left>"We all love the sound of your voice, darling; but bring me
the pretty wee thing."
</p><p align=left>Petrov jerked forward another two paces.  The veins on his
neck bulged with strain, resisting the flood of power from Rivi's
mind; but mere flesh couldn't oppose the woman's dominating will.
Roaring and weeping, Petrov was forced across the room like a
convulsive marionette, his strings pulled by the cool albino.
</p><p align=left>At last, the scepter lay at his feet.  One arm reached
downward; the rest of his body fought back, tendons standing out
like cables.  Something burst with a loud crack--his collarbone,
I think, snapped in the tug-of-war between different groups of
muscles.  It didn't matter.  Slowly, agonizingly, Petrov picked
up the scepter.
</p><p align=left>It blazed white-hot again.  I had to avert my eyes to avoid
being blinded.
</p><p align=left>"Tell the wights to obey me, darling," Rivi said.  Her voice
had turned thick and throaty, aroused.  "Order them to obey me,
and perhaps I'll let you set that bauble down."
</p><p align=left>"Obey her!" Petrov shouted to the wights.  "Do whatever she
tells you to.  I command it!"
</p><p align=left>"Very good, darling.  But I don't think you should let go of
the scepter yet.  Bring it to me."
</p><p align=left>Squinting, I looked back at Petrov.  His entire arm was
sheathed in flame, from the blazing sun of Unveiler to the
smoking flesh of his shoulder.  The air around him wrinkled with
the heat, burning so fiercely I had step back.  Still, I
considered leaping forward with my rapier, plunging one clean
thrust into Petrov's heart, just to put him out of his misery;
but what good would that do?  Rivi wanted someone to bring her
the scepter.  If Petrov were killed, she'd turn on the rest of
us.  Did I want to see one of my friends mind-raped and set on
fire?
</p><p align=left>"Open the door," Rivi commanded the wights.  "And don't let
the breathers escape."
</p><p align=left>The wights bowed to her, their eyes blazing.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Twelve wights stood against us, with the Fox also stationed at
the ready, his hands fluttering in mystic gestures--probably
preparing a fireball in case any of us tried to escape the
control room when the door opened.  Not even Kiripao made the
attempt; we were hopelessly outnumbered.  As soon as Petrov
staggered out of the room, the wights closed the door again and
barred it shut with the heavy wood beam they'd used before.
</p><p align=left>"Well, darlings, that was fun," Rivi said, as the still-
flaming Petrov dragged himself to her side.  "However, all good
things must come to an end..."
</p><p align=left>"What are you going to do with us?" Hezekiah demanded.
</p><p align=left>"I haven't decided," she answered.  "I don't know any of
you...except for Judge DeVail, of course, whose mother was a
helpful dear to keep such a detailed diary.  No doubt, you all
have your wee talents or you wouldn't have got this far.  Perhaps
I'll let you live and work for my noble cause...after a wee
adjustment in your attitudes, of course."
</p><p align=left>"What is your noble cause?" Oonah asked.  Trust a Guvner to
seek as much information as possible.
</p><p align=left>"My noble cause," Rivi repeated.  "My noble wee cause.  Well,
darlings, let me tell you a story of a regal family: rulers of
all they surveyed on a lovely Prime world planet...not a
backwater either, because they had a stable wee portal to Sigil,
which let them keep in touch with multiversal affairs.
</p><p align=left>"The royal family," she continued, "had three daughters, all
charming wee girls.  It was the tradition to teach such
princesses useful arts--skills that would help them become wise
and magnanimous rulers when they ascended the throne.  Daughter
One, whom we'll call Fatuous Smug Pig..." Rivi paused and gave us
a coquettish smile "...was educated in the arts of white
wizardry.  Daughter Two, who'll be known as Loathsomely Drippy
Cow..." another smile, "was raised as high priestess of an
appallingly goody-goody power whose name can only be pronounced
by his faithful.  I usually called him Bunghole the Simpleton,
but that's not what he wrote on his smarmy wee tabernacles.
</p><p align=left>"Anyway, Pig became a wizard and Cow a priestess.  That only
left the third and youngest daughter, whom we'll call Fabulously
Beautiful and Shrewd Beyond Her Years...or Rivi, for short.  When
it came to Rivi's education, the king and queen chose the path of
the mind, arranging for the ravishing princess to study under the
greatest psionic masters of Sigil and the Outer Planes.  It was
hard work for the poor wee girl, but she devoted herself to it
with a passion; because she dreamed of the day when she could
tear her sisters' minds to confetti.  When she could force them
to draggle their tails in the filthiest streets of the Hive.
When she could seize their pure wee brains and turn their
thoughts into cesspools.
</p><p align=left>"And why was Princess Rivi so angry with Pig and Cow?  Because
they were generous to her.  Because they were nauseatingly kind.
Because they wanted to protect their poor wee sister who was all
white like a maggot.  Can you imagine?  They pitied me.  They
actually pitied me!  Pig would come into my room at night to
amuse me with vapid tricks of sorcery, like making my dolls stand
up and say, 'Rivi, Rivi, we wuv you!'  And Cow was forever
dragging me along on her holy rounds, curing the sick, comforting
the wretched, bringing the word of Bunghole into filthy peasant
huts...all in the hope of rallying my spirits to cope with my
'condition'.  My condition!  My pale wee condition...as if I were
some repugnant cripple and soft in the head."
</p><p align=left>She stopped to glare venomously at each of us, daring us to
speak.  No one rose to the challenge.  We all knew Rivi's big
problem wasn't being an albino; it was being a total barmy.  The
lilting speech patterns, the fierce glitter of her eyes, the
rationalizations for hating her sisters...the woman was mad as
May-butter, and howling at the moon.
</p><p align=left>"Well," she continued, "despite what Pig and Cow thought, I
wasn't soft in the head--I was very, very hard, and I made myself
harder by the day.  It took me almost no time to outgrow the
limp-wristed berks hired to teach me the Will and the Way.
Without my parents' knowledge, I arranged for more suitable
tutelage: a renegade Dustman mind-flayer.  He taught me
interesting wee secrets about raising the undead, but more
importantly, he nurtured the full power of my mind.  Sorcery and
priestly magic were feeble things, sucking on the multiverse's
dugs for a few drops of power.  With psionics, the energy comes
from within; from your soul, from your hate.
</p><p align=left>"So...when I learned about these darling wee grinders, I just
had to have them.  If I could bury a city--Sigil, for
instance--in the white anti-magic dust, wizards and priests would
be helpless: as they gather their power around them, it sets the
dust on fire.  Psionics, on the other hand...it's a completely
different form of energy.  Internal--it doesn't react with the
dust.  These grinders let me shut down spellcasters of every
type, without the slightest effect on my own power.  Delightful!
I only wish I'd had them with me when I finally took on Pig and
Cow..."
</p><p align=left>Her voice trailed off, but a dreamy smile remained on her
face.  I could imagine what happened to Rivi's poor sisters...or
perhaps I couldn't.  Some things go beyond a sane man's
imagination.
</p><p align=left>"Well," said Rivi, suddenly snapping out of her reverie,
"that's all bodies under the bridge now.  You wanted me to
explain my noble wee cause, and I believe I've done so.  I want
to make every wizard and priest in the multiverse suffer the
torments of the damned...and then become my slave.  Whoosh, I hit
a victim with the white dust so she can't protect herself.  Zap,
I spend a few hours raking through her mind, until she loves me
with eternal devotion.  Whoosh again, I use the brown dust to
give my new ally back her magic; but now she casts her spells in
my service.
</p><p align=left>"I already have a list of targets in Sigil--deputies in all
the major factions.  Not people at the very top, but ones with
influential positions: clever wee dears who can arrange for me to
have private interviews with folks higher up the ladder.  Once
I've had time alone with a few factols..."
</p><p align=left>She laughed.  From anyone else, the laugh might have been
charming: totally open and honest.  It chilled me to the bone.
</p><p align=left>"Let me get this straight," Hezekiah said.  "You're doing all
this--killing all those people at the courts, manufacturing
wights, torching poor Petrov here--all because you didn't like
your sisters?"
</p><p align=left>"Oh, darling," Rivi answered, "I don't like any spellcasters.
Sorcerers and priests are all annoying sods..."
</p><p align=left>"I know I am," the Fox piped up cheerfully.
</p><p align=left>"So," Rivi continued, "consider it a public service when I
serve the wee darlings their own entrails in a bowl."  She took a
deep breath.  "Starting with the magic-users in your wee group.
I intend to rip out your brains and stuff in thoughts of my own.
By tomorrow, you'll kill your own mothers for the privilege of
kissing my toenail."
</p><p align=left>"I know I would," the Fox piped up again.
</p><p align=left>"Watch them," Rivi commanded the old barmy.  "I have to set up
a suitable place to work--somewhere I won't have distractions.
Somewhere soundproof, somewhere with clamps.  I've been meaning
to redecorate one of the lounges anyway.  Give me an hour."
</p><p align=left>"But what if these berks get boisterous?" the Fox asked.  "Can
I burn them...please?"
</p><p align=left>"No, darling, they'll be more useful to us in one piece.  But
just in case..."  She handed him the white grinder.  "Take this.
It's just barely possible they might scrape away their dust and
try something foolish.  If so, give them another blast."
</p><p align=left>"Yay!"
</p><p align=left>Cackling with delight, the Fox spun the crank of the grinder,
loosing a flurry of white that sifted down over Rivi herself.
Where it touched her skin, it was almost invisible; but her
gown's black silk was completely frosted over, making her white
from head to toe.
</p><p align=left>"Dear, dear, Fox," she chided as she waggled a finger in his
face.  "Try to be careful."  Taking his wrist lightly between her
thumb and forefinger, Rivi moved his hand so the grinder pointed
its stream toward the floor.  "As I said," she smiled, glancing
back at us, "the dust doesn't affect me.  My wee tricks aren't
magic--psionic powers use a different type of energy."
</p><p align=left>"Fire is energy too," the Fox announced.
</p><p align=left>Rivi patted his arm.  "Keep an eye on our guests, darling.
I'll be back in a while."
</p><p align=left>She turned away and began to walk in the direction of her own
quarters.  Dust spilled from her clothes with every step.  Part
way across the machine room, she looked back and called, "Heel!"
Obediently, the squad of wights lined up and traipsed after her.
Petrov, too, followed along; the flesh of his arm had burned
away, but the blazing scepter remained in his hand, fused solidly
with the bone.  Any normal man would have passed out long ago
from the pain.  I could only assume Rivi was keeping him
conscious with the power of her mind.
</p><p align=left>She waited for Petrov to catch up, then wafted a caress under
his chin.  "You'll be ever so handy come nightfall, darling--I'll
use you as a lamp."  Laughing, she strode from the room, with the
wights and the fire-ravaged Petrov shuffling along behind her.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Well," said Yasmin to the Fox, "time for you to let us out."
</p><p align=left>"Can't," he replied.  "Not supposed to."
</p><p align=left>"But it's fun to be bad," Kiripao told him.  "Don't you like
being naughty?"
</p><p align=left>The Fox smiled and nodded.
</p><p align=left>"Then let us out," Kiripao said.
</p><p align=left>"Can't," the Fox replied.  "Not supposed to."
</p><p align=left>"If I were Rivi," I murmured to the others, "I'd dance all
over the old barmy's brain to make sure he always follows orders.
He's too unreliable to trust otherwise."
</p><p align=left>"Agreed," Oonah nodded.  "I doubt if he's capable of
disobeying her directly.  We'll have to try something more
subtle."
</p><p align=left>I bowed slightly to her and leaned back against a dust-covered
control console.  Watching a Guvner be subtle could prove
immensely educational.
</p><p align=left>"Fox," Oonah called, "talk to me.  You've got us at your
mercy, right?  This is the time when it's traditional to gloat
about all your plans."
</p><p align=left>"Hah!" he replied.  "Shows how much you know.  Rivi never
tells me her plans."
</p><p align=left>"But you must have a little information...like why you were
attacking the various faction headquarters in Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"Oh that."  The Fox stuck out his tongue in distaste.  "Rivi
just wanted to bob all the records from the last expedition to
come here.  How to reach the Glass Spider, how to steer it, where
the grinders were...boring stuff.  If it weren't for me setting
fire to things, we wouldn't have fun at all."
</p><p align=left>"And how do you like to have fun?" Oonah asked.
</p><p align=left>"Burning things, of course.  This white dust is supreme.
Setting all the magicians and priests on fire...isn't that a
laugh?"
</p><p align=left>"I certainly would like to see you set something on fire,"
Oonah said.  "What do we have handy that would burn well?"
</p><p align=left>"That gnome of yours looks pretty flammable..."
</p><p align=left>"No, no," Oonah shook her head, casting a quick glance back at
Wheezle.  Our Dustman friend had made no effort to get to his
feet since the blast from Unveiler had blown him against the
wall; I hoped he was simply conserving his strength.  "Let's see
what else there is," Oonah continued.  "I'm sure you shouldn't
damage any machinery...or any of us...so we're really just left
with that useless chunk of wood right there."
</p><p align=left>Of course, she pointed to the heavy beam blocking the door.
</p><p align=left>The Fox stared at it suspiciously.  "I don't know..."
</p><p align=left>"Oh, you don't think you could burn it?"
</p><p align=left>"Of course I can burn it!" he snapped.  "But..."
</p><p align=left>His brow furrowed, as he struggled to understand whatever
misgivings he had.  In a way, I felt sorry for the old barmy: his
mind must be fragmented beyond recovery, broken by whatever hell
he had experienced long ago.  Once, he must have been a
formidable man--Oonah's mother wouldn't have adventured through
the planes with a weakling--but now he was simply a mad old
twitch, falling for a trick that wouldn't fool a child.
</p><p align=left>"I don't think you can burn it at all," Oonah said sharply,
not giving him time to recognize the trick.  "I think your flame
has gone out."
</p><p align=left>"Gone out!" he roared.  "I've got a flame the size of a bread
loaf!"
</p><p align=left>And with a bellow of arcane syllables, the Fox loosed a
fireball at the beam.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Shooting a fireball precisely is like throwing an elephant
from a catapult--you've got plenty of margin for error, but
there's going to be a splash.  In this case, the splash hit the
outer wall of the control room, giving those of us inside a view
of angry red brilliance; then it bounced back into the machine
room proper, washing gouts of flame across the collection of
pistons, gears, and camshafts gallumphing through their regular
paces.
</p><p align=left>Sturdy though the mechanisms were, they weren't designed to
withstand a sudden fiery blast.  A cog blew off a spindle; the
spindle sagged into the path of a flywheel; the flywheel flew off
its mount, and churned whackety-whack through the outer plate of
a boiler; and then there was steam everywhere, spurting from the
boiler in scalding high pressure clouds.
</p><p align=left>"Oopsy," said the Fox.  He threw himself under the control
desk where Hezekiah had found Oonah's staff.
</p><p align=left>It was high time we vacated the premises; yet despite the
pyrotechnics, Fox's fireball hadn't completely scragged the
wooden beam.  Yes, its exterior was charred and crumbly, but the
flash-fire hadn't penetrated the heart of the wood.  Kiripao
threw himself at the door with all his strength...and he bounced
back with a bruised shoulder.  Perhaps if we all put our backs to
it, the obstruction might yield eventually; but before we could
try, Oonah waved us away.
</p><p align=left>"We can't waste time," she shouted.  "Stand back."
</p><p align=left>As she raised her ice-staff, I shouted, "Don't do it!"  She
did it anyway.
</p><p align=left>A split-second before the staff fired, it blazed as bright as
the sun.  Oonah's clothes instantly burst into flame; but her
hands didn't waver an inch as she trained the tip of the staff at
the door in front of her.  A solid battering ram of ice shot from
the staff, hissing as it contacted the fires around Oonah's body.
Hot melt-water spattered us all; yet the flames only thawed the
outer layer of ice, leaving the ram with enough mass to smack
against the door with the sound of thunder.
</p><p align=left>The wooden beam shifted a scant two inches.
</p><p align=left>Screaming defiance, Oonah fired again.  Another burst of
magic-fueled heat exploded around the ice-staff, far too much to
withstand so soon after the first flames.  The staff vaporized in
her hands, blazing so blindingly bright I couldn't see the result
of Oonah's shot--my vision washed out in a blur of searing
brilliance.  Still, I heard the boom of impact, then the crunch
of timber breaking to flinders.  The door slammed open, letting
in a rush of steam from the broken boiler.
</p><p align=left>Oonah took one step toward the doorway, then dropped to her
knees.  The white dust fire had taken a terrible toll-- none of
the victims I'd seen at the courts had been so viciously burnt.
Her clothes were gone, her skin now as black as charred wood.
Kiripao leapt forward to hold her up...and as he grasped her
hand, it broke off at the wrist, like a twig reduced to ash.
</p><p align=left>"Go," Oonah said, her voice nothing but a whisper.  "Stop
Rivi.  Preserve justice."
</p><p align=left>And she toppled forward, a dead and crumbling thing.
</p>
<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="10"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
10. THREE TOOTS OF A WHISTLE
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah screamed in horror at Oonah's death.  I wished I
could find my voice to join him; but there was more pressing
business, so I drew my rapier and headed for the door.
</p><p align=left>Kiripao beat me outside, of course...and before I reached the
doorway, he dove back into the room, shouting, "Down!"
</p><p align=left>I had time to throw myself against the wall before a fireball
burst at Kiripao's heels.  A gout of flame poured in through the
doorway, lighting our faces with hellish scarlet; but no one was
in direct line with the blast, and a quick glance around showed
only minor scorching.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin grimaced.  "I take it the Fox has us bottled up."
</p><p align=left>"Hey," I shouted out to the old barmy, "Rivi said you couldn't
burn us."
</p><p align=left>"Oh, yeah," he called back.  "Sorry."
</p><p align=left>The next second, a storm of white dust came through the
doorway with the force of a hurricane.  Wheezle, just getting to
his feet, was blown backward by the wind and smashed against the
wall a second time.  Kiripao gagged on silt rammed down his
throat, then curled into a ball, racked with coughing.  The rest
of us did some coughing of our own, then took cover under
whatever desks and tables were available.
</p><p align=left>Looking through the transparent wall of the room, I saw the
source of the new onslaught--Foxy had cranked up his dust grinder
to full power and trained its punishing gush on the doorway.  He
didn't have a straight line of fire into the room, but it was
good enough to get about half the grinder's output inside the
door.  Half was plenty.  Already our exit was partly blocked by a
mound of white, and the pressure of the spray was driving more
dust inside.  Within minutes, we'd all be neckdeep in that fine
white silt; if we tried to escape in the meantime, we'd have to
fight against the powerful jet of dust, then face the Fox's
fireballs.
</p><p align=left>I looked across the room at Yasmin.  Her cheeks and forehead
had accumulated a layer of dust sticking to sweat.  "We have to
make a run for it," she shouted.  "I'll carry Wheezle.  When we
get out the door, we scatter."
</p><p align=left>She had to know how desperate the plan was: no matter how fast
we scattered, a single wide-diameter fireball could incinerate us
all.  On the other hand, did I want to stay in the control room
and wait for it to fill with dust?  Even if Foxy stopped the
spray before we suffocated, we'd be trapped in grit until Rivi
returned to rape our minds.
</p><p align=left>I nodded to Yasmin.  "Let's do it."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Kiripao exploded out of the doorway in a frenzied scattering
of dust.  Perhaps he intended to charge the Fox, because he took
a step in that direction; but Kiripao was an elf, fine-boned and
light.  The continuing torrent of dust pouring from the grinder
smashed him off balance, spun him around, and battered him back
against the outside wall of the control room.
</p><p align=left>I didn't see any more than that...because I was next behind
him.
</p><p align=left>The dust buffeted me with the force of an ocean wave,
threatening to sweep me backward like Kiripao.  I leaned into it,
hoping my feet wouldn't slip on the silken mound of silt piled on
the floor.  My eyes were closed against the dust stream, but I
could tell the moment I cleared the doorway by the sudden change
of sound--the tightly enclosed control chamber opening into the
wide and echoing machine room.  Grappling for the edge of the
door, I propelled myself forward, cutting directly across the
brutal flood of dust.
</p><p align=left>My ear, the one facing toward the flow, filled immediately
with the hammer-driven particles, clogging up so densely all
sound from that direction was cut off.  I wondered if this
deafness just came from blockage, or if the pressure of the spray
had ruptured my eardrum.  For a moment, I panicked--loss of
hearing or any other sense terrifies a Sensate.  Fear spurred me
on with desperate energy and I drove myself forward, harder,
harder...until suddenly I escaped from the pounding barrage of
dust, into the relative peace of the machine room.
</p><p align=left>Peace: deaf in one ear, and now assailed by sickening humid
heat, as the broken boiler continued to spew steam into the air.
I took a moment to wipe a clot of dust from my eyes, then ducked
behind a screeching fan-belt and turned back to see how my
comrades fared.
</p><p align=left>Kiripao had been beaten back into a corner of the room, unable
to fight the unstoppable deluge of dust.  As I watched, Yasmin
joined him--she had been right behind me as I battled my way out
the door, but had not been able to keep her balance with Wheezle
in her arms.  Woman and gnome had fallen together, and the
cascade of silt had knocked them backward across the floor, both
of them sputtering as the flood jammed dust up their nose.  They
struck Kiripao hard, all three pinned in the corner by the
pummeling stream.
</p><p align=left>"Got you!" the Fox squealed in delight.  His voice was barely
audible over the hiss of fast-flowing grit.  I saw him raise his
hands, heard him begin the chanting invocation to shoot a
fireball that would bake my friends.
</p><p align=left>"Stop!" I shouted, surging to my feet.  But my voice was
hoarse and I could never fight my way upstream against the dust
spray in time to reach the Fox.  Roaring, I threw myself into the
storm anyway, hoping the old barmy might aim at me instead of
Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>Dust slashed deafeningly around me.  When the fireball went
off, I wouldn't see or hear it; I would only feel the passing of
its heat, either striking me down or exploding around my three
allies still pressed back into the corner.  Exploding around
Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>Then, suddenly, the dust cut off like a blown-out candle.  I
had been leaning so heavily into it, I staggered and fell face
down, landing on clotted dust as soft as a pillow.  Immediately I
lifted my head and saw the Fox a few paces away, his eyes closed
in bliss, his lips still chanting the spell.  Hezekiah stood
beside him, the Clueless boy holding the grinder in his hands.
He had cranked its output down to a fraction of the former
flood...and he had aimed the resulting spray to sift lightly down
over the Fox, coating him with the purest white.
</p><p align=left>I opened my mouth, then closed it again.  Let fate take its
course.
</p><p align=left>The Fox still wore a foundation layer of the brown dust,
counteracting the anti-magic influence of the white.  However, as
the new shower of white dust rained over the brown, the balance
of energies began to shift.  Did the Fox notice?  To my eyes, the
effect was subtle at first: a gentle glow, a soft nimbus
surrounding the old man as the white dust began to fluoresce.
Miriam had told us the sorcerer was at home with fire--maybe he
didn't feel the initial heat.  But as the peak of the conjuration
approached, I could almost feel magical energy ballooning around
the Fox...and the white dust could feel it too.
</p><p align=left>With a soft puff, every dust particle blossomed with the heat
of a tiny sun.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah threw himself backward; or perhaps he was knocked
away by the heat of a million dust motes blazing like molten
steel.  The Fox's voice choked in his throat, and his mad old
eyes opened wide.  White-hot flames sizzled around him; his face
transformed to an expression of wonderment.
</p><p align=left>Embracing the ultimate fire.
</p><p align=left>Then the energies around him shredded his body to powder, and
he exploded like the giant on the Mortuary steps.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The force of the Fox's explosion blew out the closest three
pistons, blasting them into pieces of metal shrapnel that sliced
through other parts of the massive engine.  Immediately, the
floor beneath me lurched like a wagon upturned on a stone in the
roadway; and I wondered what the Glass Spider would do with one
of its drive-legs put into the dead-book.
</p><p align=left>I didn't intend to stay around and find out.
</p><p align=left>Time for the eternal chorus of anyone venturing onto the
planes, more universal than any prayer or chant or battle-cry;
and all of us yelled it in unison.
</p><p align=left>"LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!"
</p><p align=left>Miriam added, "I know the closest exit."  I'd forgotten she
was still with us, but thanked the gods of luck we had someone to
show us an escape route.  Without waiting for discussion, she
took to her heels out of the machine room, leaving a trail of
dusty footprints on the floor.  Hezekiah followed, not even
sparing a glance for the rest of us...not that we were dallying
ourselves.  As I staggered to my feet, I saw that Yasmin and
Kiripao were already moving, Yasmin cradling Wheezle's small body
in her arms.  I didn't like the look of that--Wheezle hadn't
moved under his own power for quite some time.
</p><p align=left>Still, only an addle-cove would mull that over in a room that
was ripping itself apart...which was precisely what the machinery
was doing.  Steam roiled all around us, clouding the farthest
reaches of the chamber; and every few seconds, a chunk of
hardware would rocket out of the mists with the speed of a sling
bullet.  Gears...ball bearings...thick swatches of conveyor
belt...lumps of debris, some smouldering, some crackling with
sparks of blue lightning.
</p><p align=left>In its way, the destruction ripping through the room had an
admirable kind of vitality.  An elegant thoroughness.  An
unrestrained energy that didn't care a whit for any flesh and
blood that happened to stand in its way...
</p><p align=left>"Get moving, you Sensate leatherhead!" Yasmin shouted from the
doorway.  "You want a slice-job from some flying camshaft?"
</p><p align=left>At that very moment a tiny cog whizzed past my ear, whirling
as fast as a buzz-saw; and I acknowledged that some experiences
are best postponed for one's golden years.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>A minute later, we had caught up with Hezekiah and Miriam who
were taking a breather some distance down the corridor.  Hezekiah
still held the grinder, which pleased me no end--without that
"wee bauble", Rivi's plans would go nowhere.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said to the boy, as I drew even with him.  "You
want to tell me how you did that trick back there?  One second
you were behind me in the control room.  The next, you were
showering the Fox with his own dust.  I thought Rivi had blanked
you from teleporting."
</p><p align=left>"I thought so too," he answered, panting a bit after his run
down the hall.  "But..."  He lowered his voice.  "Oonah died
right in front of us--she sacrificed herself.  And then Miriam
was watching me, as if she knew I'd do something to save
everyone...I don't know, Britlin, it made me so mad and
desperate, I felt this surge of energy, as if a little sun had
caught fire inside of me.  The next thing I knew, I was standing
beside the Fox...and he'd left the grinder just lying on the
floor while he was casting his spell...I didn't mean to kill him,
Britlin, I just thought it would stop him from finishing the
enchantment..."
</p><p align=left>Miriam took the boy's arm and squeezed it with fierce
protectiveness.  "The old berk had it coming.  Barmy as a bison
and twice as nasty."
</p><p align=left>"You used to work for him," Yasmin coldly reminded her.  "And
Rivi."
</p><p align=left>"Yeah, well."  Miriam dropped her gaze to the floor.  "I took
Rivi's jink, sure...but I didn't give a tinker's about her cause.
No one did.  And Rivi didn't give a tinker's for any of us.  You
saw how she treated Petrov; she'd do the same to me as easy as
breathing, and I'd return the favor if I could."
</p><p align=left>"What a paragon of loyalty you are," Yasmin muttered.  Turning
to the rest of us, she added, "Let's all bear that in mind, shall
we?"
</p><p align=left>"Honored Handmaid," Wheezle said, staring up at Yasmin like an
infant in her arms, "we have greater concerns than this woman's
feelings toward us."
</p><p align=left>"That's right," I put in, "like your state of health.  How are
you doing, Wheezle?"
</p><p align=left>"Most of me is doing well, honored Cavendish.  However, I have
no feeling in my legs."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah's face went pale.  The boy whispered to me, "Wheezle
hit that wall pretty hard..."
</p><p align=left>"I know...could be a spinal injury."  In a louder voice, I
told Wheezle, "Don't worry--whatever it is, they'll be able to
fix it in Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed," Wheezle nodded, "many of those in my faction have
quite remarkable magic for curing--"
</p><p align=left>The floor suddenly heaved beneath our feet, whipping all of us
against the left-hand wall.  By luck, I happened to be standing
between Yasmin and the wall's glossy steel, which meant I could
cushion her and Wheezle from full impact.  The experience was not
quite so cozy for me--Yasmin was no featherweight debutante,
starved down to look good in taffeta--but I'd had it easy so far
compared to the others, so I couldn't complain about a few
bruises.
</p><p align=left>A moment later, the floor's motion stopped; but the whole
corridor remained slanted with a leftward slope of about five
degrees.  I didn't want to guess what was happening to the Glass
Spider now that one leg was blowing its gaskets.  Long ago, one
of my father's friends had told me stories about all the planes,
including the Plane of Dust: "There's places there, boy, where
the dust runs a thousand miles deep.  You can be walking along,
dust only up to your ankles, and suddenly, the floor just drops
away and you sink forever."  If the Spider's malfunctioning leg
had somehow kicked us off the edge of safe ground into one of
those dusty morasses...
</p><p align=left>"Miriam," I said, "I believe you were showing us the closest
way out?"
</p><p align=left>"Follow me," she answered.
</p><p align=left>And we followed.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Corridors blurred by.  At first we ran full speed, but another
lurch from the Spider sent us toppling again, banging painfully
into the metal wall.  From that point on, we slowed to a nervous
trot, as fast as we could go while still retaining some hope of
staying on our feet at the next shudder.  Three more times, the
Glass Spider quaked; and each time, the floor tipped a little
more sideways.
</p><p align=left>"This feels like a sinking ship," Hezekiah blurted out as we
pressed on after the third upheaval.
</p><p align=left>"I suppose you've been on a sinking ship," Yasmin said.
</p><p align=left>"No," Hezekiah replied, "but my Uncle Toby--"
</p><p align=left>"How far is it to the exit?" I interrupted: anything to avoid
more about his sodding berk of an uncle.
</p><p align=left>"Not far," Miriam answered.  "Every one of the Spider's arms
has a portal at the bottom end.  The one back to Sigil is too far
away, but there's a portal nearby that goes to Mount Celestia."
</p><p align=left>I grunted in approval.  Mount Celestia, the Plane of Lawful
Good, was a bit restrained and conservative for my tastes, but it
certainly qualified as a safe bolt-hole under the circumstances:
the people were tolerant and friendly, the climate mild and
hospitable.  Sensates who visited there claimed it had the most
boring night-life of any plane that wasn't actually encased in
ice; at the moment, however, a short stint of tedium was just
what I needed.  No doubt we could find a portal from Mount
Celestia back to Sigil, and then we could put this whole mess
into the hands of Lady Erin.
</p><p align=left>We came to a spiral staircase just like the one we'd descended
to get to this level.  As each of us climbed, I waited for
another Spider-quake, one vicious enough to toss us screaming off
the steps; but the Fates were kind and we all reached the top
before the next tremor hit.  This tremor had none of the snap and
tumble of the previous ones, but it seemed to go on forever: a
slow and persistent drag that dropped one side of the Spider
until the floors were all slanting at a tilt of thirty degrees.
</p><p align=left>"The ship is definitely sinking," Hezekiah muttered.
</p><p align=left>None of us bothered to reply.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Miriam led us to the right, down a corridor that ran around
the outer ring of the Spider's body.  Looking out the window, I
could see that the closest legs to us had lifted right off the
ground--the opposite side of the Spider must have plunged so
deeply under the dust that the legs on our side could no longer
reach the surface.  I took some comfort in that; on this side,
we'd keep our heads above ground level substantially longer.
</p><p align=left>In fact, I was feeling positively chipper until we ran into
the wights.
</p><p align=left>Twenty wights--yes, twenty--waited in the next lounge area
around the circumference of the circle.  And at their head was a
milky transparent image of Rivi herself.
</p><p align=left>"Hello, darlings!" she called.  "After the Spider started its
jumpy wee dance, I assumed you might head for this exit.  Did you
miss me?"
</p><p align=left>"That's just a projection," Hezekiah hissed, pointing at the
ghostly Rivi.  "She can't exert any power through it."
</p><p align=left>"True," the projected Rivi smiled.  "But I can still command
these dear obedient wights to rip out your entrails if you don't
give me back the grinder."
</p><p align=left>"Sorry," I told her.  "We've grown quite attached to the wee
bauble.  It would look simply precious on my dining room table."
</p><p align=left>Rivi's projection flickered momentarily, but I could see a
storm of murderous fury sweep across her face.  It lasted only a
moment; then she forced it away and the ghostly image stabilized
once more.
</p><p align=left>"I don't want to kill you, I truly don't," she said.  "You're
dangerous people; I admire that enormously.  You've killed the
Fox, crippled the Spider, and terrified all my lackeys.  I'd love
to have you conquer the multiverse by my side.  But you must give
me the grinder."
</p><p align=left>"She's playing for time," Yasmin murmured.  "She probably has
more wights coming around behind us."
</p><p align=left>"We can't take on twenty wights in our current condition," I
replied.
</p><p align=left>"And," Miriam added, "they're standing between us and the
portal to Mount Celestia."
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah," I said, "can you teleport us around those wights?"
</p><p align=left>He shook his head.  "I don't have enough strength.  I thought
I was empty before I went after the Fox; now I know I'm tapped
dry."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle cleared his throat.  "I might have a spell that could
help..."
</p><p align=left>His face, his hair, his clothes were still caked solid with
white anti-magic dust.  "Don't do it," I told him.  "Losing Oonah
was enough for one day."  I turned to Miriam.  "You said there
was a portal at the end of every Spider leg?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes, but I don't know where they all go."
</p><p align=left>"Do you know what the keys are?"
</p><p align=left>She shrugged.  "Whoever built the Spider left keys at most of
the portals.  Not the one to Sigil--the key there is a picture of
yourself, so you have to make your own drawing.  But the other
portals have keys just lying around."
</p><p align=left>"Darlings!" called out Rivi's projection, "have you decided to
surrender yet?"
</p><p align=left>"Just about," I answered.  "Or else we've decided to...run!"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The wights were not fast runners; that's all that saved us.
We ran back the way we had come and the wights pursued, but with
the lunging arm-swinging gait of all their kind.  It slowed them
down...and perhaps they were also inhibited by the resentment of
being controlled, of being forced to submit to Rivi's every
command.  Slaves seldom move with the same zeal as those whose
wills are free.
</p><p align=left>Even if the wights could not keep up with us, the projected
image of Rivi dogged our heels every step of the way.  It didn't
move by walking or running--Rivi's pose remained as sedate as a
statue, hands folded demurely across her lap--but the projection
sped effortlessly along with us, as inescapable as starlight.
The ghostly image wove among us, making sudden darting motions,
trying to distract and confuse us, make us trip over our own
feet.  Along with the sight of her was the grating honey of her
voice, "You won't get away, you know.  I have wights all over
this building.  Give me back my grinder!"
</p><p align=left>None of us answered.  We were too busy running, trying to keep
our balance despite the aggravation from Rivi and the
increasingly frequent tremors that rocked the building.
</p><p align=left>Ahead of us was a lounge area, located at the junction of
another of the Spider's legs.  Beyond that, I could hear the
hissing of more wights racing toward us from the other direction.
"We have to take this exit," I said, pointing along the corridor
through the leg.
</p><p align=left>"I don't know where the portal goes," Miriam protested.
</p><p align=left>"Doesn't matter.  Peel it."
</p><p align=left>The corridor had originally sloped downward toward the ground;
but as the other side of the Spider sank, this side had slowly
tipped upward like the end of a see-saw.  Now the corridor angled
slightly skyward--only a bit, but it still took extra effort to
run up it.  "Kiripao," I shouted, "I sure hope you're praying to
whomever you worship that this slope doesn't get any steeper."
</p><p align=left>"It is counter-productive to pray while running," he yelled
back.  "While you are running, run.  While you are praying, pray.
Never whistle while you're--"
</p><p align=left>The Spider gave a staggering heave.  Our end of the see-saw
tilted a little higher.
</p><p align=left>"Isn't this glorious!" the ghost of Rivi crowed a hair's
breadth from my face.  "Do you find this corridor getting a wee
bit hard to climb?  You'll really have to watch your footing now,
won't you--one little slip, and you'll roll all the way back to
the waiting arms of my wights."
</p><p align=left>"Pike it, slag," Miriam snapped.  But Rivi had a point: one or
two more tremors and the corridor would become too steep to climb
without pitons.  The wights had already given up--they stood like
a pack of undead wolves at the bottom of the ramp, waiting for
their prey to slide down into reach.
</p><p align=left>The Spider rocked again.  Hezekiah gave a surprised little,
"Whoops," and nearly lost his feet; but Miriam was right beside
him and grabbed his arm before he went down.
</p><p align=left>The slope of the corridor was now more than forty-five
degrees.  It didn't help that the floor was an artificial
material as smooth as marble.  The leather soles of my boots
provided poor traction on such a surface; barefoot would be
better, but I wasn't about to sit down and waste precious seconds
unlacing.
</p><p align=left>"Poor wee darlings," Rivi mocked.  "Time is running out."
</p><p align=left>"What about you?" Yasmin snapped.  "The whole place is
sinking.  Are you planning to go down with it?"
</p><p align=left>"So what if I do?" Rivi laughed.  "The Glass Spider is air-
tight...and given time, I can find the controls to set things
right again.  You're the ones with the tight schedule.  I'm
afraid you can't take another tremor.  What do you think,
Petrov?"
</p><p align=left>And suddenly, the ghostly projection of Rivi was joined by a
second image: one whose appearance shocked me so badly, I nearly
stumbled.  Petrov stood before us, his mouth open in a soundless
scream.  Flames still surrounded him like a furnace; his arm had
burned completely down to ash.  Before Unveiler could drop from
his hand, Rivi must have forced him to press the scepter to his
chest.  Now it blazed there like the symbol on a paladin's
breastplate, grafted to his skin by the withering heat.  How
could he still be alive?  His heart and lungs must be on fire,
his throat completely seared to charcoal; and still he stood
before us, too agonized to scream.
</p><p align=left>"Release him!" Wheezle cried from his perch in Yasmin's arm.
"He has earned death.  Let him go!"
</p><p align=left>"Give me the grinder and I will," Rivi purred.
</p><p align=left>"Sorry, Petrov," I muttered, and ran through the poor sod's
projection, trying not to think of the flames.  Even the illusion
of them made me shudder.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Up ahead lay the end of the corridor, marked by a closed
doorway.  Kiripao, running several paces ahead of the rest of us,
slapped the button to open the door and leapt inside as soon as
the gap was wide enough to let him enter.  Miriam dragged
Hezekiah through a moment later, followed by Yasmin carrying
Wheezle.  As soon as I had passed the threshold, Kiripao stabbed
the button behind me and the door began to close.
</p><p align=left>The very second the door snicked shut, another tremor struck.
All five of us fell backward, striking the door with our full
weights.  It gave one loud creak, and for a moment I thought it
would give way, sending us flopping all the way back down the
corridor to the waiting wights.  I held my breath, heart
pounding...but the seconds ticked by, one, two, three, with no
sickening collapse and eventually I let the air sigh out of my
lungs with relief.
</p><p align=left>Just across the room I could see the faint glow of a portal in
the arch of the outside doorway.  Imbedded in the wall beside the
door was a steel cable from which dangled several cheap tin
whistles on strings.  Obviously, the whistles could open the
portal, and the portal could take us away from Rivi's madness;
the only problem was that the floor between us and the exit now
sloped upward at an angle of about sixty degrees.
</p><p align=left>Without hesitation, Kiripao pushed himself away from the door
at our backs.  His hands and feet were bare; although the floor
was too smooth to offer convenient handholds, he still managed to
pull himself up to the cable and seize one of the whistles.
</p><p align=left>"All right," Yasmin called, "just hold onto the cable and
lower a rope..."
</p><p align=left>But Kiripao had other ideas.  Sticking the whistle in his
mouth and blowing loudly, he threw himself directly at the
portal.
</p><p align=left>It flickered open giving a glimpse of somber gray skies
clotted with forbidding black clouds; then it winked shut again.
</p><p align=left>"Sodding berk!" Miriam shouted at the vanished Kiripao.
</p><p align=left>"Now, now," Hezekiah told her, "he's a Cipher.  He probably
decided to rush ahead and make sure the coast was clear."
</p><p align=left>"Either that," Miriam muttered, "or he wanted to give us the
laugh before the damned Spider drops completely down a hole."
</p><p align=left>"Problems, darlings?"  The smirking image of Rivi flickered
into existence once more, standing at an absurd slant in the
middle of the room.  "Abandoned by your wee friend?"
</p><p align=left>"He's just scouting ahead," I snapped, then turned my
attention toward taking off my boots.  The slope was sharp, but I
could still climb up to the door barefoot, provided the Spider
didn't tilt anymore.  I couldn't participate in the conversation
anyway--Yasmin and Miriam wouldn't have let me get a word in
edgewise, because they were too busy pouring curses on Rivi's
head.  Rather intriguing curses I might add...I certainly wanted
to find out what Yasmin meant by "that sneaky trick with the
neckerchief."
</p><p align=left>By the time I was ready to climb, Hezekiah had pulled out a
rope from his own knapsack.  "This'll be good and sturdy," he
said as he handed the rope to me.  "Uncle Toby made it himself."
</p><p align=left>"Wonderful," I growled.  But perhaps my surge of annoyance at
the mention of Uncle Toby had its positive side--it spurred me up
the incline with a driving ferocity that brought me to the steel
cable in record time.  Once I had an arm safely wrapped around
the cord, I set about fastening the rope for the others to climb.
</p><p align=left>"This is getting irksome," Rivi's image said to me as I let
the rope tumble across the slanted floor.  "Did you know,
darling, that all this time I've been standing in one of the
Spider's other control rooms?"
</p><p align=left>The image bent over, as if Rivi was reaching toward something.
Then, suddenly, the Spider careened wildly to one side, emitting
a monstrous groan of protesting metal.  Through the glassed-in
walls of the room, I saw the next Spider leg to the right snap as
viciously as a bullwhip, then come hurtling toward our own
leg...as if one leg of the Spider was attacking the next.  By my
estimation, the incoming leg would hit our own leg about halfway
down its length.  There was nothing I could do but close my eyes
and wait for impact.
</p><p align=left>When the collision came, it rattled my teeth like a punch in
the mouth.  Our leg weathered the blow rather well...by which I
mean it didn't break clean away.  After a single bone-shaking
shudder, our leg steadied back in position.  Even before the
vibrations had begun to die away, Yasmin was already climbing the
rope, with Wheezle's arms clasped around her neck.
</p><p align=left>"You were lucky, darlings," Rivi's projection said.  "The legs
aren't really designed to mount such attacks.  Then again, they
aren't designed to withstand them either.  A pity I can't move
your own wee leg to shake you off...but that's because you
destroyed the appropriate engine room.  Oh well, I'll make do."
</p><p align=left>The attacking leg swept back for another strike.  As Yasmin
reached me, I shoved a whistle into her mouth and shouted, "Go!
Go!"
</p><p align=left>"Thanks for the advice, Britlin," she muttered, despite the
whistle held in her teeth.  "I would never have thought of it
myself."  And then she was blowing on the whistle and swinging
her legs toward the portal.  As it winked open, I caught a whiff
of dank and fetid air; then Yasmin and Wheezle were gone.
</p><p align=left>Miriam and Hezekiah rushed through immediately after her,
taking advantage of the few seconds that the portal remained
open.  Rivi screeched in fury as the Clueless boy, still carrying
the white grinder, disappeared through the gate.  A split-second
later, the portal winked closed, putting the grinder finally out
of Rivi's hands.
</p><p align=left>I wished I could aim some devastating taunt in Rivi's
direction; but I had already stuffed a whistle into my mouth, and
was busy shoveling the other whistles into my pockets.  Why make
it easy for Rivi to pursue us?  Let her find her own whistle.
</p><p align=left>But I had momentarily forgotten the Spider leg that was
hurtling in on a collision course.  A leg like that doesn't move
quickly; but once it is aimed, nothing can stop it.
</p><p align=left>Like a battering ram it slammed home again, and this time the
impact nearly knocked me free from my grip on the steel cable.  I
heard a crunch, a snap...and then I could feel myself in
freefall, as my half of this Spider's leg broke off and plunged
toward the surface.  Maybe the dust below would cushion the
crash, but I didn't feel in a gambling mood.  Blowing a piercing
blast on the whistle in my mouth, I hurled myself through the
waiting portal.

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
11. THREE WELL-FERTILIZED SHRUBBERIES
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Here's a tip for any would-be bloods who may be reading this
memoir: try not to jump out of an unfamiliar portal while blowing
a whistle loud enough to wake the dead.  Stealth is
better...trust me.
</p><p align=left>Since I had swung myself through the portal feet first, I
emerged the same way, landing flat on my back in mud and still
blasting away on the whistle.  Yasmin leaned over me, snatched
the whistle from my mouth, and hissed a desperate, "Shh!"  I
shushed with all due haste; and since I expected that dragging
myself out of the muck would be a noisy process, I simply lay
where I was, hoping I had not dropped into quicksand.
</p><p align=left>Or a corrosive bog.
</p><p align=left>Or into the path of ravenous army ants.
</p><p align=left>All of which seemed distinct possibilities, since I didn't
know where the sod I was.
</p><p align=left>My view of the world was restricted to a number of tree
branches crisscrossing close overhead--gnarled and twisted
branches of mist-slick wood, wreathed with dagger-like leaves.
All the branches hung heavily with streamers of frosty green
moss, like pale fat boa constrictors lying well-fed in the trees
and letting their tails dangle.
</p><p align=left>The cool air smelled of damp-rot, strong and cloying...the
normal smell of a swamp, of course, but more intense than any
natural swamp I'd visited.  There was nothing placid in this
swamp's aura of decay, no calm decomposition of fallen leaves
into rich brown muck--I had a hunch that putrefaction here would
be swift and aggressive, enough to rot the boots off your feet if
you stood still too long.
</p><p align=left>When I thought about it, that wasn't such an unappealing
prospect: having my clothes decay off my body would be an
interesting sensation, if not downright titillating.  But I had
no time to wait for the rot to set in, because somewhere off to
my right, Hezekiah whispered, "They're coming this way."
</p><p align=left>"They heard the piking whistles," Miriam glowered.
</p><p align=left>"If I could just cast a spell--" Wheezle began, but Yasmin cut
him off immediately.
</p><p align=left>"No spells.  We're covered with dust."
</p><p align=left>"Then we must fight."  That last voice was Kiripao's...no
surprise.  Our elven monk was beginning to worry me;
impulsiveness was one thing, but his constant eagerness to plunge
into battle would spell trouble if we couldn't keep him in check.
I had to wonder what religious order Kiripao belonged to--the
monks I'd met before Kiripao had all conducted themselves with
delicate restraint, fighting only when circumstances left no
other choice.  They certainly didn't leap into combat without the
slightest attempt at parlay.
</p><p align=left>Still, I couldn't waste precious moments brooding about
Brother Monk: it was high time to get off my back, and face
whatever new ugliness was heading our direction.  The mud put up
sticky opposition to my plan, but it wasn't deep enough to hold
me securely; in three or four seconds, I had ripped myself free
and regained my feet.
</p><p align=left>We stood on a small rise in the middle of a bog that stretched
as far as the eye could see.  Stunted trees grew wherever the
ground was solid enough to support them, but much of the
landscape was covered with water: stale and brackish water, lying
in stagnant black pools.  As I continued to examine my
surroundings, the surface of the closest pool broke into rings of
dark ripples.  Something white and shapeless rose from the
depths, sucked briefly at the air, then disappeared once more
into the lower darkness.
</p><p align=left>"What are they?" Hezekiah whispered.
</p><p align=left>Was he asking about the white thing in the water?  No, his
head was turned in a different direction.  I followed his gaze
out over the swamplands...and there, coming toward us with silent
speed, were ten slices of blackness.  For brief instants, as one
or another of them glided over a patch of ground that was clear
of tree-shadow, I could make out a gaunt humanoid shape, like a
walking skeleton--a skeleton equipped with small bat-shaped wings
ending in fearsome claws.  Then the figure would move into the
shade of another tree and virtually disappear, blending so
completely with the shadows that even my Sensate's eyes could
scarcely discern them.
</p><p align=left>"Does anyone know what they are?" I whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Umbrals," Kiripao replied.  "Close cousins to shadow fiends.
Umbrals steal souls and sell them to the highest bidder."
</p><p align=left>"If they want to steal our souls," Hezekiah said, "they'll
have to use magic, right?"  He lifted the white grinder and
tapped it meaningfully against his palm.
</p><p align=left>"Use the dust sparingly, honored Clueless," Wheezle warned
him.  "Umbrals are only found on the Lower Planes; and if we have
landed on a Lower Plane, we do not want to attract the attention
of any powers who dwell here.  They may decide to seize the
grinder for their own."
</p><p align=left>"Back in the Spider," I reminded him, "you said that gods
would leave this grinder alone...that they'd be afraid of every
other god ganging up on them."
</p><p align=left>"That would be the attitude of any sensible god," the gnome
nodded.  "However, the Lower Planes are a patchwork of divine
fiefdoms, each ruled by its own distinct deity.  Every
significant god is shrewd enough to exercise caution; but there
are numerous small gods too, many of whom are gibberingly insane.
If this land belongs to one of the mad powers, we must try to
remain beneath its notice."
</p><p align=left>"Get ready to fire anyway," Yasmin muttered to Hezekiah.
"Those things are getting too close for comfort."
</p><p align=left>The umbrals were now only fifty paces away, close enough for
me to catch the occasional glimpse of mouths filled with
bristling teeth.  Those teeth could tear through throat-flesh
like a rip saw; and I didn't want them any nearer my jugular than
they already were.
</p><p align=left>"That's close enough!" I shouted.  "Stop and we'll talk."
</p><p align=left>The creatures didn't slow down.  They knew they outnumbered
us; they carried no weapons, but those teeth and claws could
shred us just as efficiently as a butcher's axe.  I drew my sword
and waited.  For the last twenty paces of their approach, the
umbrals would have to climb the rise where we stood.  Holding
this higher ground was our group's one advantage, and I intended
to exploit it to the fullest.
</p><p align=left>At the bottom of the rise, the shadow things halted...possibly
because they realized a mad rush would be risky, possibly because
they had something else in mind.  One of their number slipped
back into the thickest darkness under a tree and drew something
from a black pouch at its waist.  I could barely see the umbral,
let alone the small object it was holding; but whenever a foe
acts furtively, it's time for preemptive action.
</p><p align=left>"Down there by that tree," I said to Hezekiah.  "Blast the
berk."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah cranked the grinder and let loose a stream of dust
with all the pressure of the main jet in the Great Fountain of
Sigil.  The whiteness of the dust showered down over the fiend's
head, clearly outlining the creature's form--we could see that it
was bent over some sort of black-glinting orb and chanting an
invocation.  The spray of dust didn't interrupt the creature's
attempt at casting a spell...but the subsequent fire did.  The
umbral's body flared with the fierce white brightness of a sun,
sending its fellow fiends shrieking to cover their eyes.  In a
split second, the umbral dissipated into ash; and the orb it had
been holding fell to the muddy ground with a dull thud.
</p><p align=left>"Now can we talk?" I called down to them.
</p><p align=left>"Talk, yesssssssss," one of the other umbrals replied in a
whisper.  It rubbed its eyes furiously, trying to recover from
the blinding burst of their comrade's incineration.  "We like
talking.  Very friendly umbrals, yessssssss."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin gave a snort of disgust.  "The first step in
diplomacy," she muttered, "is always getting their attention."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>As far as I could tell, only one of the creatures was capable
of speech; the rest simply stared at us with huge hollow eyes,
their hands constantly flexing as if they longed to imbed their
claws into our flesh.  I noticed Kiripao's hands were doing much
the same thing, eager to break a few umbral heads...but he
restrained himself while I spoke with the fiend leader.
</p><p align=left>"We don't want any trouble," I told the chief shadow, "we just
want to get back home."
</p><p align=left>"Where isssssss home?"
</p><p align=left>"Sigil.  Are there any portals nearby?"
</p><p align=left>"Portalsss.  Portalssssssss."  The umbral tucked a claw under
its chin and made a show of pondering the question with great
seriousness.  "No portalsssssss here."
</p><p align=left>Kiripao growled.  "He's lying--every umbral village has a
portal in the center."
</p><p align=left>"No, no," the speaker said.  "Our people very poor.  No
portalssssss."
</p><p align=left>"There must be other villages nearby," Miriam suggested.
</p><p align=left>"Not friendly villagesss.  Wicked, greedy sssshadowsss.
Sssteal your sssoulsssss."
</p><p align=left>"Like you tried to do," Yasmin muttered.
</p><p align=left>"Sssss'sssop very young," the umbral shrugged.  "Impulsssive.
Not friendly like ussss."  It smiled an unconvincing smile and
took a step up the hill.  Hezekiah gestured with the grinder, and
the speaker backed up quickly.
</p><p align=left>"If you don't know where to find a portal," I said, "we have
nothing else to say to you.  Push off."
</p><p align=left>"Oh, oh, oh," the chief fiend replied.  "Jussst remembered.  A
portal, yessss.  A portal to Ssssigil."
</p><p align=left>"What a remarkable coincidence," Yasmin murmured.
</p><p align=left>"Yessssss, lovely portal," the umbral continued.  "Not far
away."
</p><p align=left>"A portal to Sigil?" Hezekiah repeatedly eagerly.
</p><p align=left>"Lovely clean portal, jussst your sssizzze.  Lead you to it."
</p><p align=left>"It's a trap," Kiripao whispered.
</p><p align=left>"I never would have guessed," Yasmin replied.
</p><p align=left>"Even if it is a trap," Wheezle said softly, "perhaps we
should accept their offer."
</p><p align=left>"Are you barmy?" Miriam snapped.
</p><p align=left>"I know something of umbrals," Wheezle replied.  "They are
greedy creatures...greedy to trap our souls in those orbs they
carry.  If we try to force them away, they will almost certainly
attack."
</p><p align=left>"And we would fight back," Kiripao answered.
</p><p align=left>"They outnumber us.  If they won the battle, all of our souls
would be trapped in gems forever, cut off from rightful death."
Wheezle shuddered for a moment, then continued.  "Even if we
managed to kill them all, we would surely have our own
casualties...and I do not think any of us wishes to die on a
Lower Plane.  Souls seldom escape from these planes, even in
death--we would be reborn as mindless things of evil."
</p><p align=left>Kiripao gazed at Wheezle with narrowed eyes.  "You want to go
along with these creatures because you are afraid to fight."
</p><p align=left>"Honored brother," Wheezle replied, "why not go along with
them until we see a clear chance for escape?  We are too exposed
here.  We have nowhere to run."
</p><p align=left>The gnome had a point: if push came to shove, our muddy rise
of land gave us the advantage of higher ground, but it was
exposed and visible to all the surrounding territory.  I'd
learned enough from my father's stories to know that swamps in
the Lower Planes are nasty places, filled with lurking vipers,
stalkers made of ooze, and plants that suddenly lash their
branches around your neck.  Did we want to stay in plain sight
with such threats slithering out there in the muck?  On top of
that, I wanted to get away posthaste from the portal at our
backs--nothing more than a decrepit stone arch covered with clots
of moss, but as soon as Rivi found a whistle to open the gate,
she and an army of wights would come charging into this plane to
retrieve the grinder.  By the time that happened, we had to be
long gone.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I called to the umbrals.  "Show us this portal of
yours...but no tricks."
</p><p align=left>"Tricksss?  Tricksssssss?  No play tricksss on
friendsss...promisssssssse."
</p><p align=left>For some reason, that didn't reassure me.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>We kept our distance from the fiends, giving them a lead of
about thirty paces.  "Keep peery," I told the others, as if they
needed the advice.  "We grab any chance of escape that presents
itself, and we watch for any sign of a trap."
</p><p align=left>"What kind of trap?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>I patted his shoulder.  "Let's watch for every kind of trap,
shall we?"
</p><p align=left>But that was easier said than done.  The swamp was filled with
rustles and slithers, with bogs of quicksand and shrubs sporting
poison-drenched thorns.  For the umbrals, this was home: they
knew where they could step and where they couldn't, which snakes
were harmless and which would strike if you walked within range.
The rest of us had no such knowledge; and with each step along
the muddy trail, my nervous tension screwed up another notch.
</p><p align=left>Approaching a patch of blooms whose smell made my head
spin...were they giving off dangerous gas, or just a cloying
perfume?  And that clacking sound to the right...tree branches
knocking together in the breeze, or a monster sharpening its
claws?  Every ripple in every pool...every drop of mist falling
from the leaves overhead...every insect suddenly buzzing past our
ears...we jumped at everything.  Kiripao snapped his nunchakus at
unknown phantoms; Yasmin plunged her sword into the undergrowth
once or twice a minute, never telling us what she had seen; and
even Hezekiah was jumpy, yelping at every odd gurgle of water,
every croak from a frog.
</p><p align=left>My nerves were just as strained as my friends', but I
concentrated on the umbrals, not creeping menace from the swamp
itself.  The fiends seemed in high spirits, conversing with each
other in a language that consisted of hisses and hand gestures.
From time to time they actually laughed, with a throaty sound
like a dog being strangled.  Whatever "tricksss" they had up
their sleeve, they were obviously congratulating themselves at
the cleverness of their plan.
</p><p align=left>This umbral snickering continued as they led us past a dozen
black-water pools.  After an hour or so, the tree cover thinned
as the ground grew damper; and about a league ahead there
appeared an honest-to-goodness river, perhaps ten paces wide.
Trying to get a good view of that river, I almost missed
something important closer to home: the fiends had stopped
laughing.
</p><p align=left>In fact, they had stopped talking altogether--no hissing and
none of the intricate hand gestures that made up their form of
speech.  They clutched their wings tight to their bodies, and
they walked with a cautious, silent delicacy, like cats picking
their way through mud.  Why?  I waved the others to a halt,
placed a finger to my lips, and squinted carefully ahead.
</p><p align=left>Although there were no trees nearby, the path was still
bordered by scrubby bushes, most of them reminiscent of nettles
and burdock.  At this very moment, however, the umbrals were
passing three bushes that stood out from the rest: taller and
fuller than the others, with leaves that had a soft reddish tinge
to their green.  The front fiend kept his gaze glued tightly to
the bushes as he drew near them, and his pace grew even more
cautious.  Clearly, our "friendsss" intended to pass those bushes
with the utmost silence...so just for the sake of interest, I
pulled out a whistle from the Glass Spider and blew an ear-
piercing blast.
</p><p align=left>With the force of an explosion, all three bushes expelled a
barrage of white-wood flechettes, V-shaped thorns whizzing
through the air.  The fiends were mowed down like wheat, reaped
by a thousand tiny scythes.  Shreds of shadow were ripped from
their bodies and scattered over the bulrushes behind them, black
clots flung across the green.
</p><p align=left>The leaders of the party fell butchered without a single
sound.  The ones farther back, partly protected by their fellows,
didn't die immediately, but uttered breathy little shrieks as the
projectiles cut through their bodies.  They shouldn't have made
such noise--it stirred the bushes to shoot another fusillade,
thorns imbedding themselves in shadow flesh, shadow wings, shadow
eyes.  The umbrals fell in tatters, their bodies perforated like
moth-eaten clothes.
</p><p align=left>"Quickly," Wheezle shouted, "we must get to them now!  We must
perform the proper death rites."
</p><p align=left>"Don't be barmy," Yasmin snapped.  "We can't get close to
those bushes."
</p><p align=left>"We must!" Wheezle repeated.  "Keep blowing the whistle,
honored Cavendish.  The plants cannot shoot thorns forever."
</p><p align=left>And the little gnome was right: the bushes' supply of
ammunition was limited.  When I blew the whistle again, the
responding volley of flechettes was smaller than the first two
bursts.  Three more whistles and the attacks had dribbled out; I
gave another two toots just for safety's sake, but by then
Wheezle was urging Yasmin to run full speed toward the
slaughtered fiends.  "The death rites are crucial!" he kept
shouting.
</p><p align=left>"Dustmen," Yasmin muttered and made a face.  But she bounded
into a sprint down the muddy path, goaded on by Wheezle shouting,
"Faster, faster!"
</p><p align=left>The rest of us jogged along behind, wondering what could send
Wheezle into such a tizzy.  It didn't surprise me he knew the
death rites for umbrals--Dustmen study the sentient races of the
multiverse, just to know how to bury each one.  On the other
hand, I had witnessed dozens of deaths since I met Wheezle, from
the Collectors incinerated by the exploding giant, to the Fox and
all the others we'd killed inside the Glass Spider; our gnome had
shown no urgent need to give them a proper send-off.  He hadn't
even offered a prayer for Oonah...so why did he care about
monsters who'd tried to have us julienned by vegetables?
</p><p align=left>The moment Yasmin reached the closest fiend, Wheezle demanded
to be set down.  Quickly, he plunged his hand into the umbral's
belt pouch and pulled out a dark sphere about the size of a
walnut--twin to the gem-like orb we'd seen before, the one used
by the umbral who tried to steal our souls at the portal.
Raising the orb in his hand, Wheezle called out, "Come, beloved,
to your--"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin clamped a hand over his mouth.  "No magic, Wheezle!
You're covered with dust--it's too dangerous."
</p><p align=left>"This is not magic, honored Handmaid.  I am simply calling a
soul that may yet be lingering near this body."
</p><p align=left>"Using that gem was magic before.  Remember a certain umbral
bursting into flames?"
</p><p align=left>"The umbral was attempting to steal a soul against our will;
such theft does require magic.  However, showing a soul that we
have a receptacle available for habitation...that is not magic.
The soul chooses for itself whether to enter the gem."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin didn't look convinced, but she kept still as Wheezle
called out again, "Come, beloved, to your home.  A mansion has
been prepared for you.  Live in it and be glad."
</p><p align=left>The dark orb flickered with a sudden thread of light.  The
gleaming strand shuddered once, twice, then blossomed into a deep
purplish glow.  It lit the gnome's face with a soft violet
radiance and he smiled.  "Good.  Good."
</p><p align=left>Suddenly, he tossed the orb to me with careless disdain.
"Hold onto that, honored Cavendish.  Umbrals sell souls to the
highest bidder...so can we.  It's justice."
</p><p align=left>And then he urged Yasmin to carry him to the next body.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Nine orbs, glowing purple.  Nine umbral souls, housed inside
these strange gems.  "A good haul," Kiripao said approvingly.
</p><p align=left>"You know something about the soul trade?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Some," he nodded.  "It is a popular form of commerce here in
Carceri."
</p><p align=left>"You think we're in Carceri?"
</p><p align=left>Kiripao pointed to the thorn-shooting bushes.  "Those plants
are called Tooth-Storms.  I have never seen one before, but I
have heard tales of how they...make their own fertilizer.  They
are found only in Carceri, on the swampy layer known as Othrys."
</p><p align=left>"Wonderful," I growled.
</p><p align=left>"What's Carceri?" Hezekiah piped up.
</p><p align=left>"One of the Lower Planes," Miriam told him.  "A place of utter
evil, with a dash of chaos to make things cozy."
</p><p align=left>"So how do we get out?" the boy asked.
</p><p align=left>"First, we must find an umbral village."  That answer came
from Wheezle, who lay on the chest of the last fiend and rolled
one of the soul-gems between his palms.  "As the honored Kiripao
has observed, every such village is built around a portal of some
kind.  With luck, the gate can take us somewhere less hostile."
</p><p align=left>"Walking into an umbral village will surely provide all the
hostility we can handle," I said.  "This bunch wanted to steal
our souls the moment they saw us...and their families won't be
pleased we've scragged a load of their cousins."
</p><p align=left>"Umbrals have hard hearts," Wheezle replied.  "They feel no
fondness for others of their kind, and will not grieve over those
who have died.  The one thing they do feel is greed: greed
for..."  He held up the glowing soul-gem.
</p><p align=left>"So the second we walk into a village," Miriam growled,
"they'll put us in the dead-book so they can bob our gems."
</p><p align=left>"Not true, honored ruffian.  Umbrals respect few rules, but
the trade in souls occupies the center of their lives.  If we
present ourselves as merchants with goods for sale," he held up
the soul-gem again, "they will treat us as respected guests.  We
will embark upon a formalized process of negotiation, and during
the time it takes to strike a bargain, they will provide us with
free lodging, food, and clean water."
</p><p align=left>The moment he said the word food, I could feel my stomach
rumble.  It had not been so long since my last meal--astonishing
though it was, we had only left Sigil three hours earlier--but I
was definitely growing peckish for a feed.  Was there anything
edible out here in the swamps of Othrys?  Probably, but it would
be sheer luck if we found it.  None of us had any wilderness
experience.  Kiripao showed some small familiarity with this
plane, but he hadn't recognized the Tooth-Storm bushes till they
started shooting their thorns.  That didn't bode well for
stumbling around the swamp, trying to find food without getting
eaten ourselves.
</p><p align=left>"Are you sure the umbrals won't kill us?" I asked Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>"They will rip out our throats the moment we conclude
negotiations," he answered, "but until then, they will show
meticulous hospitality.  It is their way.  Umbrals have no honor
as we recognize it, but while there is business to be conducted,
they make every show of friendship."
</p><p align=left>"Like half the merchants in the Great Bazaar," Miriam
muttered.
</p><p align=left>I was beginning to like her.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>We continued along the muddy trail in the direction we had
been traveling.  There was no guarantee it would lead to an
umbral village, but we could see it was a well-used path.  It was
also heading for the river far ahead of us, and that was another
good sign; even in the Lower Planes, it's practical to build your
village close to a waterway, for the convenience of
transportation and drinking.
</p><p align=left>An hour later, however, when we finally reached the river, it
became apparent that drinking this particular water would be
risky.  It was not just black; the water had an oily obsidian
gloss to it, as if it could immediately squash the color out of
anything that touched its surface.  The smell of sulphur tainted
the air, possibly from the water, or possibly from the curling
clumps of mist that hung above the river at random points along
its length.
</p><p align=left>As we watched, a dark skiff emerged from one of the banks of
cloud.  It moved slowly, giving us plenty of time to examine the
ornate illustrations painted on the prow--row upon row of faces,
some humanoid, some not, and all consumed with a quiet, ineffable
sadness.
</p><p align=left>In time, the skiff emerged far enough from the mist for us to
see the boatman: skeletally thin, clad in a hooded robe that
didn't quite hide the fleshless face.  A human woman sat
passenger on the wooden seat behind, her eyes sewn shut with
coarse black thread.  Her hands lay folded in her lap, and no
matter how the boat rocked on the river's current, the woman
remained immobile...as if she weren't really sitting in the skiff
at all, but gliding forward on the strength of some unknown
destiny.
</p><p align=left>The woman was Oonah DeVail.  Her soul.  Her dead spirit.
</p><p align=left>She took no notice of us as the skiff silently floated by; but
the boatman turned to look at us briefly, pale eyes in a face of
bone.  Then the skiff entered another pillar of mist and
disappeared without leaving a ripple.
</p><p align=left>"This is the River Styx," Kiripao said.
</p><p align=left>None of us spoke for some time.
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="12"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
12. THREE BLOSSOMING RAPPORTS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Our muddy trail led along the Styx for the better part of a
mile.  Then as we rounded a bend in the river, we saw a gathering
of black huts ahead, tucked beneath a grove of moss-laden trees.
The huts seemed to be sculpted from solid darkness, as if they
had congealed from the gloom of shadows that permeated the grove.
</p><p align=left>"Each of us will carry a gem," Wheezle said softly, handing
around the glowing purple orbs.  "We must all present ourselves
as soul-merchants."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah wore a pained expression.  "I don't think Uncle Toby
would approve of me--"
</p><p align=left>"Do not worry, honored Clueless," Wheezle interrupted.  "The
umbrals voluntarily chose to enter these gems.  It is how they
always expected to end their lives: as objects of trade.  And we
must remember the treasure you carry."  He pointed to the
grinder, still trickling out white dust.  "We have a
responsibility to keep that out of the wrong hands."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah nodded gravely...as if he found it obvious what the
right hands would be.  To me, the issue was not so clear-cut.  I
was inclined to pass on the grinder to Lady Erin as fast as
possible; but I knew Wheezle would want to turn it over to the
Dustmen, Yasmin to the Doomguard, and Kiripao either to the
Ciphers or to whatever power he worshipped.  When the time came,
there would be a sodding huge argument.  Still, we tacitly agreed
we didn't want the grinder taken by Rivi or the umbrals, so the
question could be postponed a while.
</p><p align=left>With each of us prominently displaying a soul-gem, we walked
toward the village.  I almost missed the sentry fiend, posted
beside the path; it stood under the hood of a willow-like tree,
glaring at us from the shadows.  When it saw I had noticed it,
the umbral took to its wings immediately, staying low to the
ground but swinging its flight-path over the Styx, getting an
unobstructed route to the huts.  Since we were still on foot it
took us longer to cover the remaining distance, forced to clamber
over fallen logs and detour around spots where the muddy bank had
crumbled into the river; so by the time we reached the umbral
village, a sizable welcoming party had assembled along the path.
</p><p align=left>Every pair of hollow eye sockets pinned a yearning gaze on the
soul-gems we carried, as if the villagers were deciding which gem
they would claim as their own.  Yasmin's free hand strayed to the
hilt of her longsword; but the fiends made no motion toward us.
They watched in silence, shadows among shadows, each sepulchral
face lit by the purple glow of the gems.
</p><p align=left>Without speaking, we walked to the very heart of the village,
coming to a circular patch of mud with a shallow flame-pit dug in
the middle.  Unfamiliar runes had been carved in the stones that
lined the pit; I suspected they were invocations to whatever god
the umbrals deemed it necessary to mollify.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle nudged Yasmin and she held him aloft, her hands under
his arm-pits like a mother lifting her child.  "Honored fiends,"
he called, "we have come to negotiate trade."
</p><p align=left>The crowd of shadows uttered no words, but they rustled like
poplar leaves stirred by a stiff wind.  Every shade-dark face
crinkled into a razor-toothed smile.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The swamps of Othrys have no cycle of morning and night.  The
sky is always somber and overcast, the air pregnant with the
anticipation of a storm that never comes.  Sages claim that the
red-tinted light of Carceri comes from the land itself; but in
the fetid umbral swamps it leaked up to the sky, then reflected
down again from the clouds, casting a cold illumination whose
chill gradually seeped into our bones.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle told us the negotiations to sell the soul-gems would
take three days--not more, not less.  I wondered what a day meant
in a place without light or dark; but Kiripao told me the umbrals
measured out time in chunks of twenty-four hours, just like so
much of the multiverse...an enigma that has puzzled more learned
brains than mine.
</p><p align=left>As promised, the fiends supplied us with all the necessities
of life, even before Wheezle and Kiripao began discussions with
the village council.  Umbral food consisted of marsh weeds and
beetles, which the others refused to eat until I assured them the
insects had an appealing nutty flavor...rather like a cross
between grasshoppers and earthworms, although the worm taste
probably came from the mud clinging to each beetle carapace.
(Haven't you found that no matter how thoroughly you wash a bug,
you can never clean away the grit that lodges in the crannies of
its exo-skeleton?  Then again, my dwarven friends say the dirt is
the best part.)
</p><p align=left>The water offered by the fiends had a greasy aftertaste, but
it was drawn from a well, not the river.  I had heard stories
about water from the River Styx--how the tiniest dribble touching
tongue or skin could erase your memories, leaving you empty as an
infant--and I worried that some portion of the Styx might have
seeped into the well.  However, after steeling myself to try a
sip, I suffered no ill effects...so I used every drop in the
bucket to wash off the sticky white dust still coating my body.
The others did the same with their own buckets, and Yasmin went
so far as to begin a tiny invocation to test whether the dust was
safely gone.  A second later, she broke out in a fit of coughing,
pressing her fists to her chest.
</p><p align=left>"What's wrong?" I asked, wrapping my arms around her.
</p><p align=left>Wheezing, she gasped out, "Lungs...my lungs!"
</p><p align=left>As I held her, waiting for her to recover, I contemplated how
much dust we must have inhaled during our fight with the Fox.
How much lurked in our noses, our throats, our bronchial tubes
and deeper?  I couldn't say; but none of us would be casting
magic for a long, long time.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The umbrals gave us a single hut for lodging, with a floor
three paces square...not much space for five human-sized people
and a gnome.  On the other hand, we weren't all going to sleep at
the same time; even with the fiends on their best behavior, we
scheduled a watch around the clock.
</p><p align=left>To prevent the enemy from catching any of us alone, we decided
to pair off.  Wheezle and Kiripao, our two most knowledgeable
bloods when it came to umbrals, would handle negotiations.
Miriam volunteered to accompany Hezekiah wherever he went,
leaving Yasmin and me together...which caused us a nervous blush
or two, but we didn't ask for a different arrangement.
</p><p align=left>The four of us who weren't negotiating took on the task of
learning if this village had a portal, where the portal went, and
what key was needed to open it.  Accordingly, Yasmin and I took a
stroll around the area, keeping our eyes peeled for the faint
glimmer of a gate.  Soon, however, I found my attention straying
to something totally unexpected: umbral art.  The huts weren't
the only things molded from solid darkness; everywhere you looked
there was brooding black statuary, sculpted from pure shadow.  A
few had recognizable subjects--a fat human man laughing wildly, a
woman being crushed under a stone--but most were utterly alien
shapes.  What was I to make of a pitted block that resembled a
human knucklebone, or something like a huge axe-head attached to
a shriveled cone?
</p><p align=left>As I was looking at this last one, an umbral slithered up
beside me and murmured, "You like ssstatue?"
</p><p align=left>"Is it supposed to be a tomahawk?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Isss abssstract," the umbral replied, sounding as if I'd
offended him.  "Isss ssstatement."
</p><p align=left>"What kind of statement?"
</p><p align=left>"Come now, Britlin," Yasmin said beside me.  "It shows the
precarious balance of all our lives...how we cling fanatically to
familiar concepts, while deep in our hearts we doubt if we've
made the right choice."
</p><p align=left>"Yessss, yesssssss!" the umbral whistled.  "Issss exactly
that."  He sidled closer to Yasmin.  "You are artissst?"
</p><p align=left>"No, I just know what I like."  She reached out to tap on the
axe-like statue, but her finger went right through.  It seemed
the shadow-stuff wasn't so solid after all.  "Were you the one
who made this?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"Made it, yesss," the umbral replied.  "Jusssst a humble
effort."
</p><p align=left>"It's very good," Yasmin said.  "It has a particularly strong
sense of form and motion."
</p><p align=left>"There's no motion," I muttered, "it's a sodding statue.  The
piking thing just sits there, doesn't it?"  In a louder voice, I
asked the fiend, "Have you considered making a piece that
actually looks like something?  Perhaps you could get a pretty
she-umbral to model for you.  Nothing develops your attention to
accuracy as much as sculpting from the figure..."
</p><p align=left>But that was as far as I got.  The fiend covered its ears with
its hands and ran shrieking into the marsh.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin patted me on the shoulder.  "I don't think they're
ready for these advanced artistic concepts."
</p><p align=left>"Primitives," I growled.  "I can't understand why their work
gets so much attention."
</p><p align=left>And for several minutes thereafter, I found myself kicking at
any pebble with the audacity to lie in my path.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Our walk through the village and outlying regions took several
hours, after which I arbitrarily declared that night was drawing
in.  Of course, there was no change in the uniform grayness of
the Carceri sky; but fatigue was pressing down on me, compounded
by the many exertions of the day.  Yasmin agreed it must be dark
by now, back in Sigil...and she took my hand as we walked quietly
back to the hut.
</p><p align=left>When we arrived, Miriam announced she had found the portal.
It lay inside a piece of sculpture shaped something like a
ruptured watermelon, with a crack down the side just big enough
for an emaciated umbral to squeeze through.  The crack was, of
course, the portal; and it remained to be seen if we humans could
fit into the gate.  We would have serious difficulty at the best
of times.  It would be next to impossible to squash through
quickly and quietly.
</p><p align=left>Alas, "quickly and quietly" was exactly what we needed.  After
hours of formal discussions, Wheezle and Kiripao had established
only one point: the umbrals would double-cross us as soon as
bargaining concluded.  The moment they handed over the agreed-
upon price, any outsiders in the village would change from
"merchants with goods to sell" into "targets with gold to steal".
Of course, the fiends hadn't said this in so many words; but the
undercurrents of gloating hostility were too obvious for our
companions to miss.  The gnome and elf insisted we must have an
escape route ready by the time negotiations ended.
</p><p align=left>I did not sleep well that night; and I was grateful when
Hezekiah woke me to say it was my watch.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>As I stepped out of the hut, I saw Yasmin already standing in
the gloomy shadows.  The sky was still gray and overcast,
unchanged since we had arrived in Othrys; but the village had a
brooding silence to it, as if true night had fallen.  No umbrals
walked the streets or hovered in the doors of their huts,
watching us with greedy eyes.  Perhaps they had gone to sleep
too...if shadows are capable of slumber.
</p><p align=left>"It's quiet," Yasmin whispered.
</p><p align=left>I nodded.
</p><p align=left>After some time she said, "Sometimes I have this vision of
Sigil, completely empty.  No one left in the city--no people, no
dogs, no rats--everyone gone but me.  I have the whole perfect
silence to myself."
</p><p align=left>"It's a Doomguard kind of dream," I said.  "The twilight at
the end of the world."
</p><p align=left>"Not the end of the world," she replied.  "The completion of
the world.  Have you ever been in a tavern when a truly great
bard starts to sing?  At first, people keep talking to their
neighbors, clinking tankards, making noise...but as the bard's
voice reaches them, they stop to listen, one by one.  The hush
spreads over the crowd, until all you can hear is the singing.
No one wants to breathe or move, for fear of missing a note of
the song.
</p><p align=left>"That's what Entropy means to me, Britlin: the beautiful song
of Time.  I dream of the day people stop their desperate
jabbering and finally hear the music."
</p><p align=left>"A pretty metaphor," I told her, "but in real life, people
don't just fall quiet and listen to the Harmony of the Spheres.
In real life, people die--often painfully and pointlessly.
Where's the music in that?"
</p><p align=left>"You're too short-sighted," Yasmin replied.  "Death is merely
a transition, like adolescence.  It may be easy or hard, but it's
not the final word.  Your soul moves on to another plane, Upper
or Lower, wherever your heart truly belongs.  And when your
afterlife ends, you move on again, absorbed into the multiverse
one way or another.  We'll all be present for the final song.
We'll all be part of the final song."
</p><p align=left>I shrugged.  "Pardon me if I want to put off choir membership
as long as possible."
</p><p align=left>"I'm a Handmaid of Entropy, not a leatherhead.  I don't want
to die in the near future either--there are still a million
things I have to do...and a million others I want to do."
</p><p align=left>"Even so, you're devoted to helping Entropy along."
</p><p align=left>She shook her head.  "Entropy doesn't need help, any more than
stars need help to shine.  Entropy is always on the job, berk,
and whatever pace it wants to move is fine by me.  I only get
annoyed when someone tries to jig the natural progression faster
or slower.  Trying to accelerate Entropy is just as bad as trying
to stop it: both are presumptuous...tinkering with the great
bard's song.  The path of wisdom is just to go about your
business and try to hear the music."  Her eyes were distant; but
suddenly she broke into a chuckle.  "By the gods, I sound
pompous."
</p><p align=left>"Let's be kind and say you're profound."
</p><p align=left>"I've never been profound in my life.  I've been..."  Her
voice broke off.  "I've been a lot of things, but never
profound."
</p><p align=left>"Tell me what you've been."
</p><p align=left>She bit her lip.  "You don't want to know, and I don't want to
remember.  Life was not good before I became a Handmaid.  Life
was very bitter and lonely."
</p><p align=left>"No friends or family?"
</p><p align=left>"No friends, bad family.  My mother died.  My older
brother--he died eventually too, but not soon enough."  She took
a deep breath and let it out slowly.  "Let's talk about something
else."
</p><p align=left>I looked at her closely.  Maybe I was jumping to conclusions,
imposing my mother's history on another woman; but the sound of
her voice when she mentioned her brother...ugly.  So much
ugliness in the world.  And despite my grousing, I knew I had
lived a pampered life, all things considered.
</p><p align=left>Reaching out, I took Yasmin's hand.  "Okay.  Let's talk about
something else."
</p><p align=left>Her mouth curved into the ghost of a smile.  "What did you
have in mind?"
</p><p align=left>"Giving this place the laugh.  Declaring that this patch of
ground is not Carceri at all, but other plane entirely.  What
would you like it to be?"
</p><p align=left>"The Plane of Dust," she answered immediately.
</p><p align=left>"Dust?" I snorted.  "Pardon me, but I was there mere hours
ago, and didn't enjoy it at all."
</p><p align=left>"The Glass Spider wasn't the real Plane of Dust," she said.
"I visited Dust years ago, while studying to be a Handmaid.  It
was very soothing.  Quiet and healing."
</p><p align=left>"But it has no air!"
</p><p align=left>"They taught us spells that could cope with that."
</p><p align=left>"You can't cast spells at the moment," I reminded her.
</p><p align=left>"Oh no?"  She draped an arm over my shoulder.  "Imagine we're
on the Plane of Dust," she said in a low voice.  "No umbrals.  No
swamp.  No smell or noise..."
</p><p align=left>"No air."
</p><p align=left>"Shh."  She put a finger to my lips.  "We're in the Plane of
Dust and I have wrapped us 'round with spells that will keep us
very safe.  Very private.  No one for a million miles around but
you...and me..."
</p><p align=left>For more than an hour after that, we weren't very good
watchguards.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Early on our second "day" in Othrys, a boatman from the Styx
arrived at the village.  At the time, Yasmin and I were sitting
on a clump of moss, watching an umbral artist shape a block of
shadow into what looked like a headless rhinoceros.  The
sculpting process appeared no different from molding clay, full
of kneading and squeezing and slapping; yet when I tried to touch
the lump of darkness, I found it as insubstantial as mist.  Maybe
the shadow-stuff existed on a shifted plane of reality, one the
umbral could contact and I could not...or maybe I was just
spouting gibberish because I didn't have any rational
explanation.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin, of course, didn't care about the "how" of shadow-
sculpting.  Every few minutes, she hiccupped with admiration as
the fiend's hands pinched out a blob of blackness or smoothed
down a dimple in the rhino's left buttock.  No doubt, my tiefling
inamorata would have happily explained how the piece symbolized
the Voice of Irony, the Cosmic Jest, or some other deep theme;
but I refused to ask.  In fact, I was delighted when a group of
umbrals broke into hysterical gabbling down by the riverside--it
gave me an excuse to leave.  Leaping to my feet I hurried to the
Styx, with Yasmin close behind.
</p><p align=left>As we came into sight of the river, the boatman's skiff was
just drawing up to the shore.  A crowd of umbrals stood back a
short distance, clacking their teeth together rhythmically.  The
sound seemed to be their way of offering a cheery hello; and they
kept up the noise as the boatman tied his skiff to a tree stump
and climbed onto solid ground.  Yasmin grabbed my arm and
whispered, "Maybe we should get out of here."
</p><p align=left>I hesitated.  True, this skeletal ferryman gave me more cold
chills than a trip to the privy in January; but he hadn't shown
any overt hostility.  The umbrals seemed delighted to see
him...and as for myself, I'd never met such a creature before.
Would he let me shake his boney hand, maybe take flaky samples of
his skin?  No--I wouldn't ask him about that at the moment.  But
I didn't want to run either.  I simply watched as his pale gaze
flicked our way then moved on, as if Yasmin and I didn't deserve
his attention.
</p><p align=left>Stepping into the circle of fiends, the boatman bowed once in
the direction of the village fire-pit, then a second time toward
the Styx.  The umbrals bowed back...and I noticed their bows were
much deeper than the boatman's, like peasants bowing to their
lord.  Dapperly waving his hand, the boatman acknowledged the
bows; then he cleared his throat with a loud raspy cough,
sounding as if he hadn't spoken in weeks.  When he finally opened
his mouth, his voice resembled the scrape of gravel on sandpaper.
</p><p align=left>"Greetings," he said huskily.  "I have come to bring light to
your dreary circle of hovels...because I find myself in need of
an artist."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's grip on my arm tightened.  I'd have to talk to her
about clipping her fingernails.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Five minutes later, the boatman's skiff was beached on shore,
open to the inspection of every fiend with artistic aspirations.
The starboard side of the bow was painted much like the skiff
we'd seen before: with a profusion of faces from many sentient
species, all of them clouded by a profound sadness.  None of
these people wept openly, or even seemed close to tears; instead,
they wore the dull expression of long-term grief, too wearily
dispirited to cry.  I had to admire the technique of the
painter--each face, rendered in muted browns, had a clinical
accuracy I found uncanny.
</p><p align=left>Unlike the painted starboard side, the port side of the bow
was completely undecorated: bare wood, simply sanded smooth.  The
planks looked freshly cut and trimmed; and as I ran my fingers
along the wood's surface, the boatman stepped up to my side.
"You will notice this is newly repaired," he said in his rasping
voice.  "My boat suffered damage after...a financial disagreement
with some passengers."
</p><p align=left>I made a sympathetic noise.  "Customers can be so hard to
please."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed.  They had quite a falling out."  He smiled.  His
teeth were yellow, with dark brown stains that gave me cause for
unpleasant speculation.  "Now that my boat has been refurbished,"
he went on, "I wish to restore the usual...embellishments."  He
turned to the crowd of umbrals.  "Your fame as artists has spread
the length of the river.  I would be pleased to pay a reasonable
commission to anyone who could copy the images from the starboard
onto the port."
</p><p align=left>A chorus of murmurs rustled through the assembly.  Every bat-
like wing trembled with dark shivers.  "Copy?" several voices
whispered.  "Copy?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes," the boatman replied.  "These faces are my personal
insignia.  I must have them painted on both sides of the bow so
that I am recognized by my...clients."
</p><p align=left>"Copy?" the whispers continued.  "Copy facesssss..."
</p><p align=left>"Surely this is not a difficult assignment?" the boatman said.
"I've brought the necessary paints, and even a few brushes."
</p><p align=left>"Not facessss," said a nearby fiend.  "Maybe nice mandala with
sssstar motif?"
</p><p align=left>"Yessss," agreed another, "or Cosssmic Egg with wreath of
ssstylized sssnakesss?"
</p><p align=left>"Ssscythes," chirped up a third, "I sssee ssstunning
asssemblage of peach-toned ssscythes, sssuperimposed on mauve
medicine wheelsss, sssurrounded by cressscent moonsss and
dolphinsss."
</p><p align=left>"Dolphins?" the boatman shuddered.
</p><p align=left>"Ssscarlet onesss.  Very pudgy, with lightning boltsss coming
out of tailsss."
</p><p align=left>The boatman made a strangled sound.  "I do not want scarlet
dolphins, whether or not they come equipped with anal lightning
bolts..."
</p><p align=left>"Isss sssymbol," an umbral put in quickly.  "Dolphinsss
sssymbolize river Ssstyx."
</p><p align=left>"There are no dolphins in the Styx!" the boatman snapped.
"There are only unpleasant creatures called hydroloths, and they
would rip a sissy little dolphin to fillets just for the fun of
hearing it squeak."
</p><p align=left>One fiend cocked its head to the side.  "Hydrolothsss look
good with lightning boltssss?"
</p><p align=left>"A hydroloth wouldn't look good if you put a bag over its
head, and one over yours while you're at it.  I do not want
hydroloths; I do not want stylized snakes; I do not want a nice
mandala.  I want an exact copy of the faces that are already on
the other side of the boat, all right?  Do you think you can
handle that?"
</p><p align=left>The umbrals bristled with artistic indignation and stormed
away, stomping louder than you'd think shadows could manage.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin stepped forward and tapped the boatman on the shoulder.
"Sir," she said above the noise of the fiends' departure, "you
don't need an artist; you need a hack.  Let me introduce the most
unrepentant hack in the multiverse..."
</p><p align=left>I tried my best to look modest.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>In the next few minutes, I learned several things: that the
skeletal boat people who ply the Styx call themselves
marraenoloths; that marraenoloths are the only creatures who have
learned the secret of navigating the river's black waters; and
that this particular marraenoloth was a haughty berk named Garou,
who refused to admit how lucky he was to find the one village in
Carceri with a painter who would (a) take his commission and (b)
not charge an arm and a soul for it.
</p><p align=left>"There is no element of luck involved," Garou insisted.  "I
simply concentrated on my need for a suitable artist, and the
Styx carried me here.  You could have been anywhere on the Lower
Planes and the river would have brought me to you...or to someone
else equally talented and perhaps less imbued with that foul-
smelling dust."
</p><p align=left>I was going to snap back a caustic reply, but stopped myself
before the words came out.  Instead, I asked, "Can you really
smell the dust on me?"
</p><p align=left>"Most certainly," Garou replied.  "And let me add that in my
day, I have inhaled the stench of rotting corpses, the reek of
embalming chemicals, the odors of a thousand types of river
pollution...but never have I smelled such a disgusting aroma as
that which arises from the dust in your garments."  He leaned
toward me, thrust his gaping nasal cavity against my jacket, and
drew in a heady breath.  "Ah yes," he sighed with pleasure,
"totally, putridly repugnant."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's jaw tightened and she let out her breath slowly.
"You're a Sensate, aren't you, Garou?"
</p><p align=left>"I have the good judgment to belong to the Society of
Sensation, yes.  Is there something wrong with that?"
</p><p align=left>"No, no," she answered, a fatalistic tone in her voice.
"Britlin, shouldn't you give him the secret handshake or
something?"
</p><p align=left>"Handshake?" I snorted.  "The formal Sensate greeting is
rather more tactile than a mere handshake."
</p><p align=left>"Indeed," Garou said.  "It requires a hundred and twenty-seven
meticulously prepared props, takes a day and a half to perform,
and may only be conducted under the auspices of a qualified
chirurgeon."
</p><p align=left>"I've done it twice," I told Yasmin.  "Remember that scar I
showed you last night?  The sodding duck moved at precisely the
wrong time."
</p><p align=left>"You too?" Garou asked with something close to sympathy in his
voice.  "I now make a point of ramming ducks with my skiff
whenever they cross my path.  Of course, all marraenoloths like
to ram ducks--it's one of our little traditions.  But for me, it
has personal meaning."
</p><p align=left>"Yes?  Then clobber one for me sometime," I said.
</p><p align=left>And if there is such a thing as friendship between humans and
creatures of evil, that was the start between me and Garou.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>

</p><p align=left>We negotiated a simple deal: I'd paint Garou's boat, and he'd
ship us out of the village before the umbrals had a chance to
butcher us.  The Styx flows through all the Lower Planes,
offering access to every form of hell imaginable; but it also
passes close to a number of portals, and Garou promised he could
take us to gates that led to relative safety.  Nothing so
convenient as a route directly to Sigil, alas--the best Garou
could offer were portals to the so-called gate-towns, outposts
which serve as staging points between the Lower Planes and the
neutral Outlands.  From the stories my father told, I knew the
gate-towns to the Lower Planes were vicious places in their own
right, tainted by evil seeping up from below...but as long as
they retained some vestige of neutrality, any gate-town would be
less lethal than where we were now.  In a gate-town, we could
contact the local chapters of our factions and get help.  After
that, we could worry about our next move.
</p><p align=left>Soon I had a paintbrush in hand, and was roughing out the
sorrow-filled faces I would have to copy.  There were sixteen of
the portraits, a day's work at most: by the time the umbrals
retired to their huts for the night, I'd be finished.  Garou
assured us he could slip our party out of town quietly while the
fiends slept.
</p><p align=left>"Can we trust him?" Yasmin whispered to me as I started to
paint the grief-ravaged face of a high elf.
</p><p align=left>"That's the question, isn't it?" I muttered.  "He has nothing
to gain by betraying us and we seem to get along passably well;
but it still might amuse him to deposit us in some festering
cesspit.  On the other hand, he is a fellow Sensate...and I think
he'll be impressed on with my work on his boat."
</p><p align=left>"Maybe you should leave one face unfinished until he takes us
somewhere safe."
</p><p align=left>"Good idea," I nodded.  "It'll give Garou some incentive to
live up to his half of the bargain."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin watched me paint a few strokes, then asked, "Which
gate-town do we aim for?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't know.  Have you visited any of them?"
</p><p align=left>"No."  She shrugged.  "Maybe one of the others has."
</p><p align=left>"Why don't you check with them?" I suggested.  "I'll be all
right here."
</p><p align=left>She stared at me for a moment, clearly debating whether she
could safely leave me by myself.  "Very well," she said at last.
"I don't want to watch you work on these pictures anyway.  Too
depressing."
</p><p align=left>"Because the faces are so sad or because it's just a hack copy
job?"
</p><p align=left>She didn't answer.  I watched her walk away.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Time passed.  Garou watched long enough to see me finish the
high elf's face, then wandered off into the village.  I took that
as a vote of confidence; he had accepted I possessed sufficient
talent for the job, and could work without his supervision.  The
umbrals were not so quick to drop the issue--I could feel their
hollow eyes peering at me from dark vantage points under the
trees, and could hear their rustling voices whisper
unrecognizable words--but in time they too faded away, vanishing
on unknown errands.
</p><p align=left>I was left alone with the grieving faces.
</p><p align=left>Whoever painted the originals had done good work: nothing too
difficult in the way of technique, yet with a sure touch in
capturing the pathos of each subject.  It was easy to believe the
faces had been taken from life; but I didn't want to pursue that
line of thought.  Sixteen people, heartsick people, herded
together and forced to pose for the unknown artist...it didn't
bear thinking about.
</p><p align=left>But I couldn't keep my mind off the subject.  Garou's previous
artist had done that old trick with the eyes, aiming them out
flat so they seemed to follow me wherever I moved; and it is hard
to bear up under such sorrowful scrutiny for long periods of
time.  Sad, mad eyes, always watching.
</p><p align=left>Among the faces was a human man, light-haired, full-bearded,
nothing like my dark and well-trimmed father...yet the more the
face stared at me, the more I felt this was Niles Cavendish: not
dead, not lost these fifteen years, but still alive somewhere
here in the Lower Planes and crushed by overwhelming grief.  Time
and again, I caught myself staring instead of painting.  It was
not my father, it was nothing like him--nothing like anything he
could have become since I saw him last.  And yet, when I was
fleshing out other faces, I would repeatedly catch sight of the
man from the corner of my eye and gasp.  My father.  Papa.
</p><p align=left>"Magic," I muttered under my breath.  "Sodding magic."  It
could have been in the paint, on the boat, or hanging in the very
air around me.  Every plane lays its fingers on your soul and
toys with you, trying to seduce you into its dance.  Carceri
wanted to embrace me with its ripe despair, and why not use
visions of Niles Cavendish as bait?  The man in the picture was
not my father...any more than I was.
</p><p align=left>That was it: I was not my father.  He had been a hero.  I was
a mere copyist; as Yasmin said, a hack.  How long before she
despised me for that?  She knew I was the son of Niles
Cavendish--we'd talked about it the night before, after...after
we'd finished being inattentive sentries.  Maybe my father was
the only reason she cared a twig for me.  Maybe she thought I was
a savior with a sword, like him; and when she learned the truth,
how I could scarcely bear thinking of him...would she walk away
disappointed, longing for a real man, and a real life, and real
emotion on the canvas...
</p><p align=left>"Painting more pictures, huh?" said a nasal voice behind my
shoulder.  "You must be really dedicated--working every chance
you get.  Uncle Toby says artists are like that."
</p><p align=left>I turned and saw Hezekiah looming over me.  For some reason,
he didn't look like a gawky Clueless nuisance at this moment; he
looked downright welcome.  "I don't know sod about artists," I
told him.  "I don't know sod about anything, except this piking
place is playing tricks with my mind.  Sit down on that stump and
keep me sane."
</p><p align=left>"How do I do that?"
</p><p align=left>"Grant me wisdom.  Grant me truth.  Grant me the secrets of
life.  Or failing that, tell me about your home town, the girls
you left behind, and your piking Uncle Toby."
</p><p align=left>Which he did.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Like every home town, Hezekiah's birthplace of Templeford had
the dewiest dawns, the slowest horses, and the tangiest cheese in
the multiverse.  The barber was missing a finger and knew more
jokes than any man in history.  The tailor who sold men's clothes
held a "going out of business" sale at least once a year.  There
were two blacksmiths, one competent, one not...and the well-to-do
patronized the fumble-fingered fellow because the other man's
smithy was always full of commoners.  Of course, no one locked
their doors at night.  Of course, everyone went skating on the
creek in winter time.  Of course, there was an old house
suspected of being haunted, a young woman suspected of selling
her nights for silver, and a butcher suspected of adding cat-meat
to the ground pork.
</p><p align=left>Born and bred in Sigil, I still knew Hezekiah's home.  I'd
never been there...perhaps no one had ever been there, including
Hezekiah.  In real towns, drunks are sad or intimidating, never
innocently amusing; and the girl next door has a complicated life
of her own, not centered on being your foil.  In real towns,
marriages are neither unending bliss or unmitigated disasters,
but always somewhere in between; and the same goes for children,
never purely angels or demons as the stories would have you
believe.  But none of us comes from a real town--we come from
home towns, where everyone is a "character" and where our
stories, smiling or angry, are all painted in primary colors.
</p><p align=left>At that moment, I liked primary colors; they were a welcome
change from the subdued browns on the palette in front of me.
Thus I let Hezekiah prattle on about the dances in Pecksniffle's
pack-barn, and the blizzard three years ago that buried houses up
to their eaves.  Was the creek full of trout in spring?  Of
course.  Did the leaves turn crimson and gold at harvest time?
Every tree in the forest.  And every grandmother could cook
better than the greatest chefs in Sigil, every grandfather could
whittle better than the most famous sculptors, every hunting dog
could sniff out a partridge ten miles away...
</p><p align=left>What about Uncle Toby?
</p><p align=left>"What do you want to know about Uncle Toby?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"He raised you?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes."
</p><p align=left>"And he taught you the tricks of mind over matter?"
</p><p align=left>"Oh sure--he taught me lots of stuff.  But..."  Hezekiah's
voice trailed off and he sighed a sigh of theatrical proportions.
</p><p align=left>"What's wrong?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Well," the boy said, "I think Uncle Toby skimped on one part
of my education."
</p><p align=left>"Yes?"
</p><p align=left>"He never...well, Uncle Toby was a bachelor, see.  He knew
about the multiverse, and the gods, and the powers of the mind,
but he never really talked about...you know."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah looked at me with anxious brown eyes.  I knew exactly
what kind of guidance he wanted, and as a Sensate, I had plenty
of experience to draw upon.  The trick was not to unnerve the boy
with excessively hydraulic details.
</p><p align=left>"What do you want to know?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Well...it's just that...ummm, well...I think Miriam likes
me."  He lifted his eyes quickly, then lowered them again.  "I
could be all wrong about this, but..."
</p><p align=left>"But you're probably right," I finished for him.  "That trick
you did back in the Spider--making yourself look terrifying--I
think that caught her attention."
</p><p align=left>"That?  But that was...she liked that?"
</p><p align=left>I held up my hands in a shrug.  "All I said was, it caught her
attention.  By now, I'm sure she realizes you aren't the demonic
horror we claimed you were.  But she's still here, isn't she?
What do you think of her?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't know..."
</p><p align=left>"Do you want her to go away, or do you want her to stick
around?"
</p><p align=left>"Oh, I don't want her to go away."
</p><p align=left>"That's all you have to know at this point," I told him.  "You
want to spend time with her and see what happens.  Right?"
</p><p align=left>"Right."
</p><p align=left>"So don't start worrying about a million other things."  I
gave him a quick smile.  "You've known her less than two days.
There may come a time when you should start thinking of the
future, but right now, stick to the present."
</p><p align=left>"Thanks, Britlin," Hezekiah answered earnestly, as if he
believed I'd given him advice instead of platitudes.  "I've been
really confused about...oh, hi Eustace, what are you doing here?"
</p><p align=left>"Eustace?" I repeated.  The boy was looking at something
behind my back.  "Eustace?" I choked.  And then I was diving out
of the way as sharp wight claws sliced down through the position
I'd occupied a split-second earlier.

13. THREE MINUTES OF DEPARTURE
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>One cannot paint while wearing a sword, so I had set mine
down...only a few paces away, but the wight now stood between me
and the weapon.  While alive, this particular wight had been
mostly human, but back a generation or two his family must have
received an infusion of giant blood-- the creature stood close to
seven feet tall, with shoulders as wide as a wheelbarrow.  He
looked vaguely familiar; and in the split second before he lunged
for another attack, I realized where I'd seen him before.
</p><p align=left>This was one of the wights attending Rivi when she confronted
us back in the Glass Spider.
</p><p align=left>"She's found us!" I yelled to Hezekiah; then I was too busy
rolling out of the way as two handfuls of talons tried to embed
themselves in my chest.
</p><p align=left>"That isn't Eustace, is it?" Hezekiah observed.
</p><p align=left>The boy was still sitting blithely on his tree stump, watching
as the wight took another whack at me.  This time, the monster
dug his claws so deep into the muddy ground I had time to
scramble to my feet before he could pull his hands free.  With a
snap of his wrist, the wight flicked the muck on his fingers into
my face, spattering my cheeks and nearly blinding me in one eye.
A moment later, he charged straight for me, hoping to run me
through while I was distracted.  He very nearly managed it too;
but I dove over the skiff I'd been painting and scudded away
along the slippery mud.
</p><p align=left>"My sword!" I gasped to Hezekiah.  "Get me my sword!"
</p><p align=left>The wight didn't bother to jump the skiff after me; he simply
bent down, planted his hands on the boat, then shoved it forward
with all his strength, like a carpenter shoving a wood-plane over
the flat of a board.  The keel of the boat skimmed up a mound of
mud as it skated over the ground, but the resistance wasn't
enough to slow down the wight.  In an instant, the skiff slammed
into me and propelled my whole body forward, knocking me roughly
down the beach.  I could handle the bruises; but another five
paces would drive me straight into the River Styx.  From the
blazing fury in the wight's eyes, I guessed that was precisely
the plan.
</p><p align=left>Digging my heels into the mud, I tried to resist the steady
push forward; unluckily for me, the wight's toe-claws gripped the
ground and gave him excellent traction, much better than the
smooth leather soles of my boots.  I slipped and slipped and
slipped again, as the wight bent his back into one heave after
another.  There was no respite to let me stand up, no chance to
scramble away around the front or back of the skiff.  It might
have been possible to clamber over the gunwale into the boat, but
that would only put me within range of the wight's life-draining
touch.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah!" I yelled.  And the lapping sound of the Styx was
almost as loud in my ears as my own voice.
</p><p align=left>The wight hissed with glee.  The river was only inches behind
me; one more push and I'd be swimming...at least for a second or
two, before the memory-stealing waters wiped out all knowledge of
how to keep myself afloat.  The wight's arms flexed, ready for
the final thrust...
</p><p align=left>...and then he stopped and turned around, an expression of
polite curiosity on his face.
</p><p align=left>Behind him Hezekiah held my sword, both hands on the pommel.
The boy had taken a swing at the wight, perhaps trying to whack
off the creature's head with a single mighty blow.  However, he'd
scarcely made a mark; he had botched the angle of attack and
delivered a glancing strike with the flat of the blade.  To the
wight, it was no more than a shaving nick.  The creature curled
his lip in something approaching a grin and reached out toward
the boy, close enough to crush Hezekiah's head like a wineskin.
</p><p align=left>That's when I shoved on the boat with all my strength and
caught the wight at the back of his knees.
</p><p align=left>The skiff was the perfect height for buckling the monster's
legs.  He jerked backward, trying to keep his balance; and at the
same time, Hezekiah had the presence of mind to jab forward with
the rapier.  It didn't actually pierce the wight's chest--the boy
hadn't kept his wrists straight as he thrust out--but the tip of
the blade banged against the creature's breastbone, giving him
some extra momentum for falling.  As the wight began to topple
backward, I reached up and helped him along, grabbing a handful
of his ripped clothes and yanking with all my strength.
</p><p align=left>For a moment, the wight's arms flailed.  His rotting face
loomed close to mine, his pointed teeth gnashing, his hot breath
hissing rankly against my cheeks.  Then he was spearing down
headfirst into the black water, his body collapsing into globules
of greasy pus the moment he hit the surface.
</p><p align=left>I froze.  He hadn't made much of a splash as he went under,
but a small shower of droplets had spattered over my clothing.
Should any of that wetness soak through to touch my skin...so I
didn't move, didn't breathe, didn't blink an eyelash.  If I lost
my memory now, I'd have to start experiencing life all over again
from the very beginning.  I might even have to eat another
swineberry.
</p><p align=left>Seconds passed.  The only dampness on my flesh was sweat,
pouring out in gushers.  Thank all the friendly powers, the day
had been cool and I was wearing my jacket; it had given me that
extra bit of protection against the splash.  At last I let out a
shuddering breath and struggled to my feet.
</p><p align=left>"That was exciting, wasn't it?" I said to Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>He nodded.  "I can hardly wait to tell Miriam."
</p><p align=left>"Wonderful.  Give me my sword."
</p><p align=left>"Could I practice a little with it?"
</p><p align=left>"No.  Give me my sword."
</p><p align=left>"Yes, Britlin."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>No other wights showed their decaying faces before lunch.
Over the meal, however, the six of us met and agreed it was only
a matter of time before we received more undead company.  Rivi
must have brought the Glass Spider back to an even keel, then
sent wights through the portal to search for us.  When that ugly
basher from the riverside didn't report back to Rivi's base, she
would eventually muster other wights to find us.  Dangers like
the Tooth-Storm bushes might slow her forces down, but I doubted
the nasty wee albino would be completely stymied by such
nuisances.  To someone as vicious as Rivi, the swamps of Othrys
might look as congenial as a backyard garden.
</p><p align=left>The news was not good from Wheezle and Kiripao either.  For
the umbrals, negotiations were a process of "becoming one
mind"...a process that consisted of long silences, punctuated by
grisly stories of life among the fiends.  "The stories are bad,"
Wheezle murmured, "and the silences are worse.  They press in on
one's brain..."  He shook his head and refused to say more; but
his face looked more haggard than it had through all the trials
of the Glass Spider.
</p><p align=left>After lunch, the others accompanied me back to the Styx,
keeping watch as I continued painting the boat.  I welcomed their
presence as a way to steer my mind away from morbid brooding; the
face of that man on the bow looked less like my father while
Miriam was telling about a drunk who walked into a tavern of
centaurs and called it a "hay bar".
</p><p align=left>So the afternoon passed with inconsequential conversation.  By
the time Garou returned to view the work, my stomach was growling
for supper...which just goes to show what addle-coves stomachs
can be, since I was not looking forward to forcing down more
bulrushes and beetles.  The boatman looked over my shoulder for a
few moments, gave a soft sigh, and said, "I suppose it will do."
</p><p align=left>"It's an exact copy," Yasmin offered on my behalf.
</p><p align=left>"Close enough," Garou replied.  I recognized the voice of a
customer who doesn't want to sound too enthusiastic for fear the
price goes up.  "Have you decided where you want to go when the
job is done?"
</p><p align=left>"Do any of us know anything about the gate-towns?" I asked the
others.
</p><p align=left>"I know people in Plague-Mort," Miriam answered.  "I've been
there a couple of times."
</p><p align=left>"What's a Plague-Mort?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"Gate-town on the edge of the Abyss," Yasmin replied.  "From
what I've heard, it's a depraved and violent place to spend your
time."
</p><p align=left>"No worse than a lot of neighborhoods in Sigil," Miriam
protested.  "And it has some first-rate taverns."
</p><p align=left>"Dens of iniquity?" Hezekiah asked hopefully.
</p><p align=left>"Dens, yes," Miriam said, "but I wouldn't use big words like
iniquity there, unless you want your teeth shoved down your bone-
box.  A bunch of us from the Glass Spider had some fine nights in
Plague-Mort."
</p><p align=left>"From the Glass Spider?" I choked.
</p><p align=left>"Sure," she replied.  "One of the Spider's portals led
straight to a Plague-Mort butcher shop."
</p><p align=left>"It seems to me," Yasmin said, "if there's a direct portal
from the Spider to Plague-Mort, we should head someplace else.
We don't want to make it easy for Rivi to find us."
</p><p align=left>"Rivi's looking for us here," Hezekiah piped up, coming to
Miriam's defense.  "This Plague place is several planes away,
right?  She won't suspect we've gone there."
</p><p align=left>"True," Yasmin admitted.
</p><p align=left>"And I know the lay of the town," Miriam said.  "I also met
someone there, claimed she knew a portal from Plague-Mort to
Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"Was this someone you could trust?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Depends what you mean by trust," Miriam replied.  "Her name
was November.  Would I let her hold my jink-bag for a few days?
No.  But if I gave her a handful of gold, would she stay bought
an hour or two?  I think so.  She showed me a license from the
Arch-Lector authorizing her to 'arrange divers services' for
visitors to town...which probably means she knows who to bribe to
get things done.  I know how bloods like November work--they peel
your pennies every chance they get, but they won't try to do you
a slice-job."
</p><p align=left>I had to admit I'd met the same sort of person, in Sigil and
most other places I'd visited in the universe.  If you wanted a
room or a meal or some lamp oil, she'd escort you to an
establishment that overcharged and slipped her a kickback under
the table; but in exchange for wringing your purse dry, she'd
honestly take good care of you.  Then again, I'd met some not-so-
honorable "city guides" too--the kind who smiled with helpfulness
till nightfall, then led you straight into ambush.  Usually,
there was no way to distinguish the two types.
</p><p align=left>"We should go to the Plague place," Hezekiah said with
surprising firmness. "Anywhere else would be worse, right?"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin looked at me.  I shrugged.  "From everything I've
heard, all the Lower Plane gate-towns are bad.  If Miriam knows
Plague-Mort and can find us a quick way back home...Garou, I
assume you can ferry us to Plague-Mort?"
</p><p align=left>"The Styx does not touch on the Outlands anywhere near Plague-
Mort," the marraenoloth replied, "but I can take you to a portal
which jumps to the town."
</p><p align=left>"And you can supply us with a key to that portal?" Yasmin
asked.
</p><p align=left>Garou smiled.  I've never liked the sight of a smile on a
fleshless face--it's all in the mouth, without touching the eyes.
"As it happens," the boatman said, "the key to that particular
portal is an open bleeding wound.  I would be happy to supply you
with an appropriate gash; but I suspect you'll be spoilsports
about that."
</p><p align=left>A bleeding wound: just what you'd expect to open a portal in
the Lower Planes.  I shuddered and kept on painting.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The light never changed, the clouds never varied...but night
fell.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle and Brother Kiripao emerged from the hut where they
had been "negotiating".  They looked exhausted, and were
deliberately vague about what had happened in the most recent
discussions.  "We learned how the umbrals think," Kiripao said.
"I have never...pondered such subjects before."  He refused to
say anything else.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle looked worse and said nothing for the first few
minutes in our company.  After a while, he chose a moment when
the others were engaged with trifling conversation and dragged
himself close to me.  His still-useless legs trailed along behind
him through the mud.
</p><p align=left>"Honored Cavendish..." he murmured.
</p><p align=left>"Yes?"
</p><p align=left>"The umbrals have undeniable powers of persuasion."  He mopped
his brow with the hem of his sleeve.  "I told you they want us
all to become 'of one mind'.  Do you know what that means?"
</p><p align=left>"Tell me."
</p><p align=left>"We talk of ourselves...they talk, Kiripao and I talk.  All
together in a single hut.  It becomes hard to breathe; their
bodies take on a peculiar smell; the room darkens almost to
blackness..."
</p><p align=left>"In other words," I said, "there's magic at work."
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps."  The thought seemed new to him.  "Perhaps magic.
Perhaps the power of their thoughts.  But there were
times...times I felt I was losing myself.  Becoming one of them."
</p><p align=left>"Maybe that's why they spend so much time over negotiations
like this," I suggested.  "After all, how long does it take to
agree on a simple selling price?  But if this bargaining process
is actually some kind of assimilation that takes three days to
complete..."
</p><p align=left>"It could be," Wheezle nodded.  "I do not think I can
withstand another day in that hut.  By the end, I would be an
umbral...mentally, if not physically."
</p><p align=left>"Not to worry," I assured him.  "We're getting out tonight:
Garou will help us escape to Plague-Mort.  Of course, Plague-Mort
has risks of its own--"
</p><p align=left>"Please," the gnome interrupted, holding up his hand.  "I do
not wish to hear about risks, honored Cavendish.  If you believe
this is our wisest course of action, so be it.  As long as we
leave tonight."
</p><p align=left>I patted him on the shoulder.  "We're just waiting for the
umbrals to go to sleep."
</p><p align=left>But the umbrals showed no sign of sleeping.  There were always
a few of them sliding silently through the streets, though they
had long ago abandoned their daytime activities of sculpting and
harvesting beetles from the marsh.  Even when I couldn't see the
fiends amidst the shadows under the trees, I could still feel
their hollow eyes gazing at us from the pockets of darkness.
</p><p align=left>At last Miriam whispered the words that must have been on
everyone's mind.  "Something's up tonight.  Maybe they suspect
we're trying to give them the laugh."
</p><p align=left>"Impossible," Kiripao answered immediately.  "They cannot know
our thoughts."
</p><p align=left>I looked at him and wondered why he used that turn of phrase.
Know our thoughts.  Kiripao and Wheezle had been cloistered with
the fiends most of the day, with the purpose of becoming one
mind.  Perhaps our monastic companion was steadfastly trying to
deny something he secretly feared was true: that as umbral
thoughts invaded his brain, some of his own thoughts bled into
the fiends.  They might have caught enough psychic vibrations to
know we were jumping their cage tonight...which was why they now
kept a peery eye on us.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah turned to Garou, who was sitting watching me paint.
I had already explained I would not finish the job until we'd
reached some sort of safety; the marraenoloth was not pleased,
but he wasn't surprised either.  "So little trust in the world,"
he had sighed.  Now he looked at Hezekiah and said, "What do you
want?"
</p><p align=left>"Do you know what the umbrals are up to?" the boy asked.
</p><p align=left>"I believe they will hold a revel--in honor of negotiations
with your group.  They will dance, they will sing, they will play
the pipes...all to make you feel at home, of course."
</p><p align=left>He cracked a wicked smile at Kiripao and Wheezle.  The elf
quickly spun away to face the Styx, but the gnome simply stared,
his face slowly turning ashen.  In a strained voice, he finally
said, "I do not think I can tolerate any sort of carousal.  It
might...overwhelm me."
</p><p align=left>I knew piking well what he meant.  If he and Kiripao were in
danger of being assimilated, the last thing they needed was an
umbral orgy getting under their skins.  Music, dance, perhaps
debauchery...even in the absence of magic, those were powerful
forces for establishing communal unity; and there would be magic
at work too, I didn't doubt that.
</p><p align=left>In the heart of the village, fire blazed to life in the flame-
pit: a fire that burned as scarlet as blood.  "Isn't that
interesting," Hezekiah said.  "The wood here must have strange
alchemical properties to burn such an odd color of red.  Uncle
Toby would be interested in--"
</p><p align=left>"Hush!" Wheezle snapped, the sharpest I'd ever heard him
speak.  That didn't bode well; the strain was already showing on
his face.
</p><p align=left>And then the pipes began to play.
</p><p align=left>I couldn't see the pipers, let alone the pipes--the flame-pit
was fifty paces away, too far to distinguish unmoving umbrals
from normal shadows--but my ears were keen enough to identify the
instruments as simple unreeded flutes, made from some wood like
bamboo or rattan.  A trio of the flutes played, weaving together
three separate melody lines with a subtle dissonance that made my
flesh crawl.  Wheezle clapped his hands over his ears and began
to whine softly.  Kiripao just listened slack-jawed, as if he had
lost the ability to move.
</p><p align=left>"We have to get out of here," Yasmin whispered to me.
</p><p align=left>"Don't rush your painting," Garou snapped.  "I'll be very
upset at a slapdash job."
</p><p align=left>"I'm just about done," I told him, then turned to Hezekiah.
"Can you teleport yet?"
</p><p align=left>"Sure, I just needed some sleep," he replied.  "What did you
have in mind?"
</p><p align=left>"Jump from here to our hut, gather everyone's packs, then
teleport back here."
</p><p align=left>"On my way," he nodded, but Yasmin stopped him with a hand on
his arm.
</p><p align=left>"Is it safe for him to teleport?" she asked me.  "Remember the
white dust."
</p><p align=left>"The dust doesn't affect psionics," I reminded her.  "That's
why Rivi wanted the grinders in the first place--the dust stops
other people's magic but Rivi's own powers stay intact.  Get
going, Hezekiah."
</p><p align=left>The boy furrowed his brow, then winked out of existence
without a sound.  "I'll have to learn that someday," Miriam
muttered.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle began panting.  Yasmin wrapped her arms around him and
tossed a meaningful look in my direction.  I knew what that look
meant: finish the painting fast.
</p><p align=left>Fortunately, I was close to the end.  In fact, I'd been
dragging things out over the past hour, waiting for the umbrals
to slink off to bed.  Three minutes would be enough to finish as
much as I wanted to; I just hoped we had that much time.
</p><p align=left>Up at the flame-pit, someone started playing a drum: a soft
pattering beat, like raindrops.  Wheezle groaned.  I dipped my
brush into the paint and concentrated on not making mistakes.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Two minutes later, Hezekiah returned with our gear.  By then,
Yasmin was rocking Wheezle like an infant, while he whimpered,
"No...no..."  A few paces away, Miriam stood beside Kiripao,
ready to wrestle him to the ground if he took one step toward the
center of the village; but the elf had not budged, simply
blinking at the distant fire and swaying in time with the flutes.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said with a last swipe of the brush, "I'm done.
Let's go, Garou."
</p><p align=left>"Are you mad?" the boatman asked.  "We can't put into the
river till the paint dries."
</p><p align=left>"The paint is more than a foot above the waterline," I told
him.  "It will be perfectly all right if you keep the splashes to
a minimum."
</p><p align=left>"I shall not be the one to splash," Garou replied.  "Your
companions, however, may choose to rock the boat."
</p><p align=left>"Miriam," I said without looking at her, "can you safety-proof
our friend Kiripao?"
</p><p align=left><THUD>, "Oof!", <THUD>, "Oof!", <THUD>.
</p><p align=left>"He'll be quiet as a lamb now," Miriam announced.  She and
Kiripao would no doubt debate the ethics of sucker-punches when
the elf woke up, but that could wait.
</p><p align=left>"Put him in the boat," I told her, "and let's get out of
here."
</p><p align=left>Under Garou's supervision, Hezekiah and Miriam eased the boat
into the water, while Yasmin held Wheezle and I packed equipment.
"Peel it away," Wheezle muttered.  "Peel away the shell."
</p><p align=left>"What's he talking about?" I said.
</p><p align=left>"Look," Yasmin replied, nodding toward the fire in the center
of the village.
</p><p align=left>The umbrals had begun to caper around the flames, a dance with
slip-sliding shuffles and extravagant leaps through the blood-red
fire itself.  Back-lit by flames, one fiend stood motionless at
the center of the dance, hissing the same words as Wheezle: "Peel
it away.  Peel away the shell."  Then the umbral reached up to
its face, dug its talons into the skin of its cheeks, and raked
down with all its strength.
</p><p align=left>The flesh fell away: ribbons of it, sloughing off in tatters.
Beneath was something darker--pure shadow, the blackness that had
been visible in the umbrals' hollow eyes.  Faster and faster the
creature slashed at its skin, ripping away the dross and letting
it pile up on the ground.  Naked darkness emerged...still shaped
like an umbral, but much harder to see, even silhouetted against
the flames.  The figure seemed to flicker with every move of the
fire, blending into the shadows cast by the other dancers.
</p><p align=left>"Peel it away," hissed a second umbral.  "The shell, the
shell..."  And its claws sank into its face up to the quick.
</p><p align=left>"Sod me," I thought; I was seeing the umbrals' true form for
the first time.  The bodies they had previously worn were
conveniences, garb for everyday.  Now they had revealed their
genuine selves: shadows of profane blackness, the stuff of
nightmares.
</p><p align=left>"Peel it away," Wheezle giggled.  "Peel away the shell."
</p><p align=left>His fat little hands reached up toward his face.  I barely
caught them in time; a moment later, and he would have raked out
his eyes.  "We have to get to the boat," Yasmin shuddered.
"Maybe if he can't hear the music..."
</p><p align=left>It was awkward getting into the skiff, with Yasmin holding
Wheezle, and me holding the gnome's hands.  The boat rocked
precipitously on the greasy waters of the Styx; then Garou
plunged his punting pole down to the river bottom to hold the
craft steady.  "If you've damaged my paint job..." he growled.
</p><p align=left>"My paint job," I replied, "and I'll fix it if I have to."
Looking around, I saw Hezekiah and Miriam at the far end of the
boat, arranging the unconscious Kiripao into a safe position.
"Get us out of here," I said to Garou, as I struggled to keep
Wheezle from clawing his face.
</p><p align=left>"One last thing," Garou replied.  "You may think of the Lower
Planes as a crude and vicious place, but manners are manners."
He held up his head and shouted to the dancing umbrals, "Thanks
for your hospitality.  We're going now."
</p><p align=left>"You berk!" Miriam exploded.  She lifted her fist but Hezekiah
caught her arm.  "You sodding, sodding berk!" she cried at the
marraenoloth.  "They'll come after us now...and we're sitting
ducks out here on the water."
</p><p align=left>"That's what we get for making deals with evil," Yasmin
muttered.  She snatched up her sword and thrust the point a
hair's breadth away from the boatman's face.  "Get us out of
here, Garou, or I swear you'll die before we do."
</p><p align=left>"You have your hands full already," he sneered, and nodded
back toward the flame-pit.
</p><p align=left>Shadows were speeding toward us; shadows racing on scaled bat
wings, vanishing into every pocket of shade beneath the trees as
if they were winking out of existence.  Their wings rustled like
leaves on the clammy air--a hundred umbrals, stripped of their
outward flesh, angry to be cheated by our escape.
</p><p align=left>I shouted to Hezekiah, "Take Wheezle," and heaved the gnome
toward the far end of the skiff.  There was no time to see if the
boy managed to keep the Dustman from harming himself; I grabbed
one of our packs from the floor of the boat and threw open the
flap.  "Garou," I snapped, "it may seem like fun to betray us,
but remember I haven't finished the painting.  You think you can
find a painter like me anywhere else in the Lower Planes?  One
who won't try to pike you the way you're piking us?"
</p><p align=left>"Don't be so melodramatic," the boatman replied.  "I'll get
you out of here."
</p><p align=left>Languidly, he pushed off the bank with his pole.  "Faster!"
Miriam cried.
</p><p align=left>"And ruin my paint job?  I think not."  He planted the pole
with extravagant slowness and gave a soft nudge.  The boat moved
inches forward, drifting into the river's sluggish current.
</p><p align=left>"Ten seconds before the fiends get here," Yasmin murmured to
me.  "Are you the sort of man who likes to hear mushy things
before he dies?"
</p><p align=left>"I'll let you know if I come close to dying," I told her.
Looking back over my shoulder, I saw the fiends were almost upon
us: pure darkness, with teeth.  "Chew on this!" I yelled, as I
plucked a soul-gem from my pack and hurled it into their midst.
</p><p align=left>The rushing horde hissed like hot iron thrust into ice water.
The three frontrunners all fell back to catch the prize,
colliding with the fiends racing up from behind.  I heard a dull
crunch, the sound of delicate wing-bones breaking in the tangle
of bodies.  A moment later, two fiends fell screeching out of the
scrum, their wings trailing uselessly behind; they both caromed
off the bank and into the water, where their caterwauling stopped
abruptly.
</p><p align=left>Several more seconds passed as the mob of flying fiends fought
over possession of the gem.  At last, a victor shot away from the
group, clutching the gem to its chest--the gem's purple light
throbbing against the umbral's blackness.  A few fiends broke off
to pursue the one with the gem, but the rest turned back toward
us and howled with fury.
</p><p align=left>"Yeah, yeah," Miriam growled back.  Following my lead, she had
fished out another gem from our packs; now she hurled it full-
force at the screaming fiends.
</p><p align=left>"Please don't rock the boat, madam," Garou chided.
</p><p align=left>"Please get the lead out of your sodding arse," Miriam snapped
back.
</p><p align=left>"Language, language," Garou sighed.  He gave another half-
hearted push with his pole, sending us out a few more inches into
the stream.  The current angled the prow around and drew us
forward, aiming us toward one of the pillars of mist hovering
above the Styx.  My guess was that each such cloud acted as a
portal, opening to another part of the river on a different
plane; even spurred by greed, umbrals would fear to follow us
through...I hoped.
</p><p align=left>The struggle to claim Miriam's gem ended after only a few
seconds.  No one's wings broke; indeed, a few of the fiends
ignored the gem entirely, circling around the other umbrals and
continuing to pursue us.  Did that mean they wanted to attack us
more than they wanted to claim a gem?  Or had they remembered we
possessed many such gems, free for the picking if they managed to
dump us in the Styx?
</p><p align=left>I had plucked up another gem and Yasmin had found one too; we
threw simultaneously, aiming for the closest fiends.  One fiend
managed to catch a gem, and was immediately set upon by two
others.  The remaining gem was fumbled by clumsy-clawed hands and
fell toward the river.  Two fiends dove for it at full speed;
they reached the gem simultaneously, clonked heads like a clown
act, and plummeted the rest of the way into the water.  A moment
later they surfaced, sputtering and gasping.  Both gripped the
gem...and both stared at its purple glow as if they'd never seen
such a thing before.  There was no way to tell how much the water
had affected their memories, but they goggled at the gem with
obvious greed, like crows coveting a shiny bauble.  Immediately,
they began clawing and biting at each other, splashing showers of
greasy water into the air.
</p><p align=left>"Peel it away," Wheezle shouted.  "Peel away the shell!"
</p><p align=left>"Britlin..." Hezekiah gasped, as he struggled to hold the
gnome's hands.  "We've got more trouble."
</p><p align=left>I glanced in his direction.  At first, I couldn't tell what
Hezekiah was talking about; then I saw that Wheezle's eyes had
turned into hollow pits of blackness, as empty as the night sky.
Nightmare eyes.  Umbral eyes.
</p><p align=left>"He's converting," Yasmin said.  "What do we do?"
</p><p align=left>"Keep throwing gems," I answered.  "Keep the fiends off our
backs until we get into that mist."
</p><p align=left>I nodded toward the closest bank of cloud, but Garou gave a
low chuckle.  "You'd be very upset if I took you through that
one.  There's no air on the other side, and the temperature's
cold enough to freeze your eyeballs to ice cubes."
</p><p align=left>"How do you know?" Miriam asked.
</p><p align=left>"It's my business to know," Garou replied.  "We're heading for
that fog there."
</p><p align=left>He pointed to another patch of mist, some fifty paces away.
It seemed like a long distance with a swarm of fiends screaming
for our blood; I wondered if Garou was stringing us along, taking
pleasure in our fear.  "Make it snappy," I told him, "if you ever
want your painting done."
</p><p align=left>"Britlin!" Hezekiah cried again.  "Hurry!"
</p><p align=left>Wheezle's fingernails had begun to extend into claws, ripping
at Hezekiah's hands as the boy tried to hold him still.  The
gnome hissed and growled, spitting out words like a snake
spitting venom.  "Peel, peel, peel!  Peel away the shell!"
</p><p align=left>There was another soul-gem in my hand; perhaps that would
pacify him.  But when I dropped the gem in Wheezle's lap, it only
spurred him to greater exertions, screaming and foaming at the
mouth.  Bar that then--I grabbed the gem and threw it at an
umbral flying less than two yards behind the boat.  The fiend
caught the gem, squealed in triumph, and sped away, three other
fiends chasing him.
</p><p align=left>"I can't help but think," Yasmin said matter-of-factly, "that
our visit has had a negative effect on this village's sense of
community."
</p><p align=left>"Peel, peel, peel!" screeched Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>"I can't hold him," Hezekiah warned.  The gnome's claws had
torn the boy's hands bloody.
</p><p align=left>"Damn it," I said.  Poisonous umbral thoughts must be filling
his mind completely.  If only...
</p><p align=left>I froze.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  My
sword lay on the floorboards, ready to be snatched up if I needed
to fight the fiends.  I grabbed it now, dipped its tip into the
Styx, and lifted it out again.  Carefully, I moved the blade over
Wheezle's screaming face and let a single drop fall on his cheek.
</p><p align=left>He stopped shouting immediately.  To be precise, he fell
completely quiescent, as if he had plunged into a coma.  Two
seconds later, we passed through a pillar of mist and the rest of
the world fell silent too--the hissing of umbrals, the splashes
of fiends fighting in the water, all vanished in a trice.
</p><p align=left>We emerged into a bleak expanse of gray.
</p>

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
14. THREE PLANES TO PLAGUE-MORT
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>The sky had a mournful lack of color, like a muted winter's
day when the snow falls somberly from dawn to dusk.  The land was
equally bleached of anything to please the eye: nothing but dying
willows and poplars, their leaves white, their bark black, all
drooping limply along the shores of the Styx.  Gray mold fuzzed
over the soil, stifling any chance for grass to struggle up into
the light...but I wondered if even grass would have the heart to
grow in such a cheerless world.
</p><p align=left>"The Gray Wastes," Garou announced...as if any of us needed to
be told.
</p><p align=left>In the Walk of Worlds at the Sigil Festhall, the Gray Wastes
were portrayed in dignified shades of silver, with soft enchanted
mists draping demurely over the entire scene.  It was a popular
room for elderly lovers, dancing with unhurried composure to the
slow music that plays continuously.
</p><p align=left>But there was no music in the real Gray Wastes.  I doubt if
you could find lovers of any age, and unhurried composure would
quickly degrade into dejected lassitude.  The oppressive gloom of
gray trees/gray land could deflate the most confident of spirits.
</p><p align=left>"Lovely day," Garou said, inhaling deeply.
</p><p align=left>He had no reason to inhale.  Admittedly, the plane offered
breathable air, but it was completely devoid of smell.  No odor
came from the trees, the moss, the oily river water...I sniffed
at my own skin, damp with the sweat of exertion and fear; but I
couldn't smell the slightest hint of perspiration.  In a way, it
was worse than going blind.
</p><p align=left>"How's Wheezle?" I asked loudly, to force my mind onto other
thoughts.
</p><p align=left>"Better," Hezekiah replied.  The gnome's hands had reverted to
normal, the claws shrinking as quickly as they had grown.  His
eyes looked like gnome eyes, watery and brown, not empty hollows
in his face.  The single drop of Styx water had made Wheezle
forget all that had happened to him among the umbrals, had purged
his mind of their influence; the only question was, how much more
of his memory had it stolen?
</p><p align=left>"See if you can wake him up," I told the boy.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah gave the gnome's cheek a few light pats, and said,
"Come on, Wheezle.  Wake up, come on."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle stirred.  His eyelids fluttered and his gaze focussed
on Hezekiah.  "Who are you?" he asked.
</p><p align=left>"You remember me--Hezekiah Virtue."
</p><p align=left>"Ah."  Wheezle's voice sounded polite, but dubious.  "Who are
all you other people?  Why can't I move my legs?"
</p><p align=left>Garou laughed.  "Think of the positive side: at least he still
remembers how to talk."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>As closely as we could figure, Wheezle had lost a year of his
life: a year of unreclaimable experience vanished like smoke.  To
a Sensate, stealing those memories was a hideous crime; I cringed
with guilt at the thought.  Certainly, splashing him with that
drop of water prevented him from turning into an umbral...but I
felt as if I should have found some less destructive way to help
him.
</p><p align=left>My father would have thought of something.
</p><p align=left>Garou poled on past the silent gray banks, as the others
explained to Wheezle what had happened.  He took it calmly, for
the most part; he even thanked me for saving him.  His voice,
however, had nothing in it but formality, good manners without
warmth...and his hands were continually straying down to his
useless legs, pinching the skin as if he could not accept that he
would live paralyzed all the rest of his days.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle lapsed into silence soon enough; and the rest of us
found we could think of nothing to say to each other.  The gray
quiet pressed in around us, muffling emotion as well as sound.
It was actually a relief when Kiripao woke and grabbed Miriam by
the front of her shirt...but his anger evaporated almost
immediately into a slump of exhaustion that laid him down on the
floorboards.
</p><p align=left>"Are you all right?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"I'm tired," Kiripao answered softly.
</p><p align=left>"If your mind is full of umbral thoughts," Hezekiah pressed
on, "Britlin has found a cure."
</p><p align=left>"Yes?"  Kiripao did not sound hopeful.
</p><p align=left>"It's only a last resort," I said.  "Why don't you sleep for a
while?  Now that we're clear of Carceri, the umbral influence
should fade."
</p><p align=left>Kiripao didn't answer.  He closed his eyes, but I could tell
he was nowhere near sleeping.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Time passed like an old man on weary legs.  This stretch of
the river had its share of misty patches, but Garou steered
around them.  Once I came close to asking him how much longer
we'd have to travel through this soul-wearying plane; but the
effort of opening my mouth seemed too great to bother.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin leaned back against me, her head settling against my
chest.  The feel of her there was a comfort; I wrapped my arms
loosely around her, and after a while, the warm solidity of her
body eased some of the dissipated melancholy weighing down my
heart.  Touching me must have had the same bolstering effect on
her, because after a while she found the strength to ask Garou,
"How much longer here?"
</p><p align=left>The boatman's eyes grew a deeper black, just for a second.  In
that moment, I had a flash of insight: that Garou was toying with
us again, just as he had alerted the umbrals to our departure out
of sheer malignant whim.  Garou wanted us to succumb to the
dreary oblivion of this place, the dull ache of its
emptiness...not because he planned to rob us, sell us into
slavery, or otherwise exploit the erosion of our wills, but
simply because he liked to see us miserable.  Suffering for
suffering's sake: just to know he had the power to get under our
skins.
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I said loudly to him, "are we going to hang around this
boring place much longer?  It's putting me to sleep."
</p><p align=left>Garou let out an angry snort and stabbed his pole into the
water.  "If you're so impatient," he replied, "perhaps we'll take
a short-cut."
</p><p align=left>With a ferocious shove, he sent the skiff veering into a patch
of mist we had almost passed by.  The fog thickened around us
until I couldn't see Yasmin's head still pressed against my
chest; then the clouds wisped away and we were somewhere else.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Open water spread without end beneath a jet black sky.  There
were no stars, but three moons, all of them full--a white moon, a
silver one, and a moon of frosted green, each lunar face pocked
and ravaged with craters.  The moons cast enough light to provide
a clear view around us: the waters of the Styx, as foul and fetid
as ever, streaming out like a malodorous black stripe across an
otherwise crystal sea.  Two paces away the sea water glistened
with the dappling of moonlight, as calm as a windless lake.  The
sight made me yearn for a swim in the soft, beckoning waters; but
even as I tried to touch the cleanness beyond the polluted path
of the Styx, a body bobbed to the surface.
</p><p align=left>The body was naked and female, possibly human...but it was
difficult to be sure, given the bloat of the corpse, plus the
damage done by fish and eels.  The woman's ears were completely
eaten away; the fingers were simply bones held together by
gristle, and the cheeks were both torn open into ragged holes.
As I watched, a delicate silver pilchard darted in through one of
the cheek cavities, bit into the dead woman's tongue, and tried
to wrestle away a piece of pink meat.
</p><p align=left>I had to look away.  When I did, I saw other bodies drifting
up out of the sea, as if our arrival had loosed them all from
some confinement fathoms below.  Each corpse was tattered with
bite marks; each belly was swollen with the gases of decay.
</p><p align=left>"A pocket in the Astral Plane," Garou said.  "The Sea of the
Drowned."
</p><p align=left>But Yasmin looked at the woman closest to us and whispered,
"Mother."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The woman's half-eaten eyelids opened.  I saw now that her
eyes had a tiefling cast: blood-red and feline, with no
discernible whites.  She did not move a muscle, but her body
circled on some undetectable current until her face was focused
on Yasmin.  "I have been recognized," she said, in a breathy
voice that released the stink of gases from her gut.  "What do
you ask?"
</p><p align=left>"Nothing," Yasmin answered immediately.  "I don't want
anything from you.  Go away."
</p><p align=left>"What do you ask?" the woman said again.  Her breath fouled
the air like sewage.
</p><p align=left>"I told you, I don't need anything.  I don't want to talk to
you."  Yasmin snatched up her sword, though the body was floating
just too far to reach.  "Go back wherever you came from."
</p><p align=left>"Impossible," the dead woman said.  "I have been recognized.
What do you ask?"
</p><p align=left>"I ask you to get out of my sight!"  Yasmin's voice was
becoming shrill.  "Now!"
</p><p align=left>"That is not within my power," the floating corpse replied.
"What do you ask?"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin balled her hands into fists and covered her eyes.  I
put an arm around her shoulder and growled at Garou, "What's this
all about?"
</p><p align=left>For a moment he didn't answer, perhaps debating whether the
truth would cause us more pain than ignorance.  Then he said,
"Nothing truly dies in the multiverse.  When a soul is killed in
one place, it is merely re-embodied on another plane...but with
no memory of its former existence."
</p><p align=left>"Any leatherhead knows that," Miriam muttered.
</p><p align=left>"But if the memories are gone, where do they go?" Garou asked.
"They can't just vanish--the multiverse doesn't let anything slip
through its fingers so easily.  Every dying person's memory
drifts like flotsam on unseen tides, until it fetches up in a
holding basin like this one.  Here lie the remembrances of all
those drowned on a million worlds.  I could show you other such
memory sinks: the Poisoned Jungle, the Plain of Knives--"
</p><p align=left>"What do you ask?" interrupted the floating corpse.
</p><p align=left>"Why does she keep saying that?" Yasmin whispered.
</p><p align=left>"The memories are drawn to those who knew their owners in
life," Garou replied.  "If you recognize and name them, they are
compelled to reveal a secret to you.  Your mother-- or rather,
the cast-off memory of your mother--will not rest until she has
discharged this burden."
</p><p align=left>"What do you ask?" the dead woman said.  She spoke in a
monotone, devoid of emotion; yet I suspected she would follow us
the length of the Styx until we had let her disclose something of
her past.
</p><p align=left>"Ask her anything," I told Yasmin in a low voice.  "If you
don't have an important question, ask something trivial.  What
she had for breakfast the day she died."
</p><p align=left>But Yasmin wasn't listening.  She simply stared at the
floating woman, an unreadable expression on her face.  Yasmin had
never spoken to me of her mother, nor revealed a word about her
childhood...but then, we'd had so little time to talk.  Anyway, a
child may have a hundred hard questions to ask her mother, and be
afraid of every answer.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin licked her lips.  "Who..."  She cleared her throat.
"Who was my father?"
</p><p align=left>The corpse sighed.  I could almost see the air thicken with
the bilious smell of corruption from her guts.  "Your father was
a man, a human man," the woman said.  "For the week we were
together, he called himself Rudy Liagar.  But later, much later,
I saw him from a distance in the streets of Sigil; and every
tongue chanted admiration for the hero, Niles Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>Without hesitation, the corpse disappeared once more beneath
the clear moonlit water.  I would have sold my soul for her to
leave ten seconds earlier.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"It could be a lie, couldn't it?" Hezekiah said, when no one
else spoke.  "Some kind of demonic trick..."
</p><p align=left>His voice trailed away.  Even a Clueless boy knew when he was
grasping at straws.
</p><p align=left>Still, Yasmin turned to me with a fierce look in her eyes.
"Tell me it is a lie, Britlin."
</p><p align=left>I couldn't meet her gaze.  All I could say was, "My father was
a hero, not a saint.  I know he had other women: mostly short-
lived romances during his adventures, but a few dalliances in
Sigil too.  It always made me so sick at heart, but...never mind.
I usually didn't know the women.  One of them might have been
your mother; but by all the gods, Yasmin, I never suspected...if
I ever suspected..."
</p><p align=left>Could I say it would have made a difference?  It made a
difference now, yes, with Yasmin staring at me in horror; but
still, the sight of her, the brown skin of her shoulders, the
flow of her body...could I have resisted her on mere suspicion?
</p><p align=left>"It's possible," I sighed.  "It's very possible.  What else
can I say?"
</p><p align=left>Miriam made a spitting sound.  "How about saying, 'Who the
hell cares?'  I've been watching you two; I have eyes.  And the
way I see it, people should play things for themselves, and pike
the rest of the world.  Why should fathers and mothers matter?
The past is past, and bloody good riddance.  Seize the present,
make it yours, however you want.  It's your own hearts that
matter, and sod all else."
</p><p align=left>None of us said anything in reply.  Garou laughed and continue
to pole past the silent floating bodies.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The skiff was moving swiftly at last.  Our marraenoloth
boatman had no more reason to dawdle; he had hurt us and was
happy.  Soon we entered another spume of fog, leaving behind the
haunted moonlight and coming out under a swollen red sun.  A wash
of heat struck our faces, like stepping into the Great Foundry
when the furnaces blazed their brightest.  In seconds, sweat was
dribbling profusely down my forehead.
</p><p align=left>The banks of the Styx rose high on either side of us, twenty
feet tall and made of dusty red clay.  Much of the bank was
covered with bramble, a thick brush reminiscent of Sigil's
omnipresent razor-vine; but in spots, recent earthslides had left
patches of bare dirt, now squirming with ants and beetles.
Fossilized bones poked out from the soil, all of them blood-red,
of no recognizable species.  A skull with three fat horns
protruded some distance over the water...and each horn ended in a
screaming skeletal face.
</p><p align=left>"The uppermost level of the Abyss," Garou announced, "called
the Plain of Infinite Portals.  We're not far from a portal that
can take you to Plague-Mort."
</p><p align=left>"And you'll show us which that is, right?" Hezekiah said.
</p><p align=left>"All part of the service."  The boatman bowed mockingly.
</p><p align=left>The river soon widened and the banks fell away, to reveal a
desert of rusty gravel and stone.  Here and there, pools of
molten metal dotted the landscape, sizzling with bright orange
heat; their shores were scattered with lumps of glowing lava,
spat out by the pools as subterranean gases belched up to the
surface.  I could see no lifeforms larger than insects moving
amidst this desolation, but I was sure bigger game lurked out of
sight--creatures that could eat our party and wash it down with a
slurp of liquid iron.
</p><p align=left>"Just your typical homey hell," I said aloud; and I huddled
myself sullenly on my chosen thwart of the boat, refusing to gawk
at the infernal scenery.  As a Sensate, maybe I should have tried
seeking out ever more sulphurous fumes to sniff, or strained my
ears to hear the wailing of the damned...but frankly, I wasn't in
the mood for such melodramatic fizz-fazz.  I'd seen lava before.
I'd tasted iron-contaminated dust.  For a while, let the world
rot on without my active participation.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Garou put in at the base of a ruined bridge: a construction of
pure white marble that seemed to have dropped in from the Upper
Planes by some fluke of magic.  Local citizens had obviously
taken offense at the arrival of such a pristine celestial object,
and demolished the central span--fallen chunks of marble
congested the river below, raising doubt whether we could sail
our way past.  However, it appeared we didn't need to; Garou
pointed up the bank and said, "There's your portal."
</p><p align=left>We all looked.  Hezekiah was the first to say, "I don't see
anything."
</p><p align=left>Garou chuckled, in a tone I had come to dread.  "It's up
there, my esteemed passengers.  Do you recall I said the key was
an open wound?  Go up there bleeding, and see what happens."
</p><p align=left>"How addle-coved do you think we are?" Yasmin demanded.
</p><p align=left>But Hezekiah had the required addle-coved look in his eye, the
kind that was seconds away from volunteering.  The boy took a
moment to look over at Miriam; and I realized he wanted to show
her how brave he was.  The truth clicked for Miriam too.  Before
Hezekiah had a chance to speak, she hopped from the boat and
growled, "Wait here, you berks."
</p><p align=left>"You'll need this," I said, holding out my sword.  She stared
at it a moment, then swiped her finger along one edge of the
blade, opening an inch-long cut.  Her expression didn't change as
she squeezed the edges of the incision to force out a line of
blood.  Then she slapped the blade out of her way and walked away
from the river, with an obvious stiffness to her gait.  I
suspected Miriam hadn't made many sacrificial gestures in her
life, and she was floundering in self-consciousness trying to
pull this one off.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah hopped out of the boat himself, with every sign of
following Miriam into whatever nasty surprise awaited.  Yasmin
grabbed him by the shirt-tail and held him back; but she stepped
out on land too, and unlimbered her sword in case she had to run
to the rescue.  In short order, we were all poised on the bank,
weapons ready for action.
</p><p align=left>Now that we were on our feet, we had enough height to see a
large carcass lying on the sandy red dirt, about forty paces
inland from the Styx.  The dead thing might have been an elephant
before the scavengers got to it, but it was hard to tell now.
Dozens of carrion-eaters had already eaten their fill, and now it
was the turn of the flies, buzzing all over the corpse as they
chewed inroads through its leathery hide.  When Miriam
approached, the buzzing increased; like sharks, the flies could
smell her blood from many paces away.  I tightened my grip on the
pommel of my sword, and offered up a prayer to any friendly
powers who might be listening--if those flies went for her, we'd
have a sod of a time getting them off.
</p><p align=left>No sooner had the thought entered my mind than it came true.
</p><p align=left>As a single mass, the flies lifted off the carcass and swarmed
Miriam, roaring.  Flies covered her face like a buzzing hairy-
legged veil; they clotted her clothes and tangled themselves
blackly in her hair.  The densest concentration, however,
attached themselves to her hand, to the finger with the bleeding
cut.  They teemed there by the hundreds, a thickening ball of
insects the size of a massive beehive.  Their weight dragged
Miriam down to her knees...and I could imagine the ones closest
to the wound jostling each other to attach their filthy sucker
mouths for a sip of human blood.
</p><p align=left>"We have to save her!" Hezekiah cried, taking a step forward.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle, lying on the ground at the boy's feet, grabbed the
leg of Hezekiah's pants.  "Wait, honored Clueless.  If this were
a true feeding frenzy, the flies would have flayed her to the
bone in the blink of an eye.  She is still alive; wait."
</p><p align=left>Miriam was so carpeted with flies, I couldn't tell how Wheezle
knew she still had flesh on her skeleton...but perhaps Dustmen
have an instinct that can sense life and death.  I stared at her
fly-laden body, trying to discern any sign of a living woman
beneath the buzzing mass; and as I watched, a few flies struggled
out of the clump on her hand and soared into the air.
</p><p align=left>The flies were glowing red, like blood-colored sparks.
</p><p align=left>Moment by moment now, more of the insects were taking their
leave, all of them blazing the same color.  They flew a short
distance, then simply stopped and hovered...until enough of them
had taken position to show they were arranging themselves in an
arch.  A red-glowing arch.
</p><p align=left>"A gate of flies," Kiripao murmured.  His voice betrayed an
unhealthy tone of rapture.  Clearly though, he was right.  As
more flies tasted Miriam's blood, they too joined the arch,
filling in a parabolic curve that shimmered with buzzing power.
Other flies, still clinging to Miriam's body, flapped their wings
in unison, raising enough wind to spin up dust-devils in the
surrounding red sand.  They didn't have the strength to lift a
full-grown woman into the air and fly her through the portal; but
they generated sufficient force to propel Miriam forward, still
on her knees and blinded by so many insects on her face.
</p><p align=left>At the very last moment the flies scattered away from her,
swarming off her skin and clothes, giving her one last push
toward the glimmering arch.  Miriam toppled forward, head and
chest crossing the line.  Immediately, they vanished into
darkness beyond; a moment later, the rest of her body was sucked
through, as if some monster had grabbed her by the arms and was
dragging her away.
</p><p align=left>"Well, that was amusing," Garou said with a raspy chuckle.
Standing beside him, Hezekiah tried to punch the boatman in the
jaw; but Garou caught the fist in his own hand and squeezed until
the boy grimaced with pain.  "You're amusing too," Garou laughed.
He shoved the fist away, and Hezekiah backed off, nursing his
knuckles.
</p><p align=left>"We have to do something," Hezekiah muttered to the rest of
us.
</p><p align=left>"Wait a second longer, honored Clueless," Wheezle told him.
"The honored thug-lady--"
</p><p align=left>"Miriam," Hezekiah interrupted.  "Her name is Miriam."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle dipped his head, as much of a bow as he could manage
in his condition.  "Your honored Miriam may well..."
</p><p align=left>The flies, mostly quiet for the past few seconds, suddenly
burst into a thunderous buzz.  The hovering archway, still
intact, darkened again; and this time I could see that the other
side wasn't complete blackness, but simply a normal night sky,
scattered with clouds.  Miriam emerged from the darkness, her
face fly-specked, but definitely in one piece.
</p><p align=left>A very angry piece, I might add.
</p><p align=left>"Garou!" she roared, loud enough to be heard over the din of
buzzing flies.  "You're going for a swim, you berk!"
</p><p align=left>The boatman curled his fleshless grin at the rest of us.
"Cherished friends, if you'd be so good as to prevent your
comrade from rash action..."
</p><p align=left>"Oops," said Yasmin, "my boots are all dusty."  She bent down
and busied herself picking invisible flecks of dirt from the
black dragon skin.
</p><p align=left>"Sorry," I smiled at Garou, "I have to finish that last
painting."  I picked up a brush and made a show of cleaning the
bristles.
</p><p align=left>Garou looked nervously at the approaching Miriam, much closer
now and still furious.  "I brought you all to a perfectly
respectable gate," he stammered.  "It leads to Plague-Mort and
you can see this woman is unhurt..."
</p><p align=left>"You should have warned her about the flies," Hezekiah said.
The boy stepped back to give Miriam a clear path to the boatman.
</p><p align=left>"A swim should not harm you," Wheezle added.  "Your kind are
immune to the Styx, are they not?  Unlike the rest of us."
</p><p align=left>"Make him suffer," Kiripao murmured softly to no one in
particular.  "Make him wriggle with fear.  Come from the shadows,
come from the night..."
</p><p align=left>"Hush," Wheezle told the elf.
</p><p align=left>"I can defend myself," Garou told Miriam in a cracked voice.
"I have powers beyond your mortal ken."  He lifted his hands in
something that might turn into a mystic gesture.
</p><p align=left>"Naughty, naughty," I said.  In my hands was the salt grinder.
A moment later, Garou was covered with white dust.  "If you try
any magic now," I told him, "you'll really regret it."
</p><p align=left>He tried anyway.  He howled in pain as the dust briefly flared
with heat.  And that was about the time Miriam grabbed him by the
scruff of the neck and heaved his flailing body into the river.
</p><p align=left>The splash was magnificent.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Garou came up spluttering.  The dunking hadn't washed off much
of the dust--I doubt if Styx water can make anything clean--so
there were patches of white caked wetly all over his head.
"You'll regret this," he coughed.  "You have earned the enmity of
the marraenoloth race..."
</p><p align=left>"Why?" Yasmin snapped back.  "You set a price for transporting
us here.  We paid it.  And for all the other services you've done
us--alerting the umbrals to our escape, showing me my mother,
feeding Miriam to the flies without warning her--well, we've paid
you for those too.  And a damned low price too, considering.
You'll dry soon enough.  How soon do you think Wheezle will get
his memory back?"
</p><p align=left>Garou dragged himself onto the bank and lay there glowering.
A sweep of sand clung to his wet clothes, forming a crusty red
layer over the dusty white one.  "My anger is not so easily
calmed," he rasped.
</p><p align=left>"You aren't looking at this the right way," Hezekiah said.  He
squatted over the dripping boatman, much closer to the Styx water
than I would have dared.  "Back in my hometown," the boy told
him, "people were constantly throwing me into the river too.  It
was just their way of being friendly...you know, smearing your
face with swineberries, pulling down your pants in public,
pelting you with horse apples...it's all in fun.  Like I'm sure
when you yelled good-bye to the umbrals, you were just playing a
joke, right?"
</p><p align=left>Garou looked up at Miriam, who happened to be cracking her
knuckles meaningfully.  "Yes, a joke," the boatman answered
hurriedly.
</p><p align=left>"And throwing you in the Styx was the same kind of joshing
around," Hezekiah said.  "Miriam's way of being friendly.  We're
all friends now."
</p><p align=left>"Absolutely," Garou nodded.  "Just high-spirited
monkeyshines."
</p><p align=left>"He fears us," Kiripao whispered to me.  "The dust has robbed
him of his power, and he grovels before our strength."
</p><p align=left>"We aren't so strong ourselves," I whispered back.  "Keep
quiet."  In a louder voice, I said, "Now that there are no more
bad feelings...Miriam, what's on the other side of that portal?"
</p><p align=left>"Rich Man's Row in Plague-Mort," she answered, still glaring
at Garou but restraining her fists.  "I recognized the street.
It's night there now; a bit cold for my tastes, but nothing
unnatural.  The town looked pretty quiet."
</p><p align=left>"You see?" Garou asked.  "I kept my part of the bargain."
</p><p align=left>"That's why I only threw you in the drink," Miriam told him,
"instead of feeding you your ears."
</p><p align=left>"Then let me finish my part of the deal," I said, "and we can
get out of here.  I've had enough of the Lower Planes for a
while."
</p><p align=left>The others fanned out in a watchful circle as Garou beached
the skiff and I went to work with the paints.  Hezekiah held
Wheezle in his arms, ready to dash for safety if the need arose;
and Yasmin stayed close beside Kiripao in case Brother Elf broke
into more umbral babbling.  Kiripao certainly had the twitches,
hearing sounds and smelling odors the rest of us couldn't
detect...but Yasmin reined him in with a gentle hand on his arm,
and nothing unfortunate happened.
</p><p align=left>From time to time, I glanced in her direction.  She wouldn't
meet my eye.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>It took me ten minutes to finish the last painting.  My nerves
were on edge the whole time--this was, after all, the Abyss,
filled with some of the most hellish creatures in the
multiverse--but apart from a green-fire explosion many miles
away, we saw no sign of trouble.  I took my time to get the final
face right, did some touch-up on the other faces, then pronounced
the work done.  Garou wasted another five minutes on close
scrutiny of each grieving figure, but that was expected; I had
already sized him up as a customer who would love to find fault
if it existed, but not the kind who invents last-minute changes
just to impose his stamp on the artist's work (like a dog,
urinating on a stick to make it smell more like himself).  The
faces I had painted were exact copies of the ones on the other
side of the boat...and eventually, Garou had to admit it.
</p><p align=left>"Acceptable," he said grudgingly.  The boatman bowed a a
fraction of an inch, and in a formal voice recited, "Britlin
Cavendish of Sigil, there is no bad will between us."
</p><p align=left>I supposed that was a ritual farewell among his people.  For a
moment I considered giving him my business card, in case he or
his fellow marraenoloths had work for me in future.  Then my gaze
lighted on that picture of the man who reminded me of my father;
and I decided I could do without such employment.
</p><p align=left>"Good-bye, Garou," I told him.  "Safe journeys."
</p><p align=left>But he was already putting his skiff back into the Styx.
Within seconds, he had disappeared into another pillar of mist.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Slowly, our group trudged away from the river.  The archway of
flies was gone; the insects, no longer glowing, had returned to
picking apart the elephant carcass.  They buzzed lethargically as
they sucked at the leathery hide.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle cleared his throat.  "It seems we must open the gate
again."
</p><p align=left>"Count me out," Miriam snapped.  "I refuse to be smothered by
bugs twice in one day."
</p><p align=left>"We could draw lots..." Yasmin said, with an obvious lack of
enthusiasm.
</p><p align=left>"Don't you dare," I told her.  "Treats like this should be
savored by those who appreciate them."
</p><p align=left>And in the next minute, a million flies gave me an experience
I shall not easily forget.
</p>

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
15. THREE HOURS OF AUTUMN NIGHT
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>A fly-spawned wind thrust me onto the cobblestoned streets of
Plague-Mort.  I landed on my knees, just short of an open sewer
that was surprisingly empty of slops; water running at the bottom
of the ditch showed that it must have rained here recently.  The
air had a just-washed cleanness to it, touched with the
bittersweet fragrance of woodsmoke.  As Miriam had said, the
night was cool: an autumnal chill, as if the land had grown tired
of life and longed for winter's oblivion.
</p><p align=left>Footsteps sounded behind me.  I turned to see Kiripao pounce
onto the street, followed more warily by Yasmin and the others
emerging into this plane of reality.  The portal they used was
simply the doorway of a house--a house whose windows had been
broken and whose walls had been vandalized with the word Traitor!
written in red paint.  The woodsmoke smell came from inside, and
suddenly the odor didn't seem so dreamily nostalgic.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah sniffed, then turned toward the house.  "Fire?" he
asked, looking around at the rest of us to see if we smelled it
too.  The boy took a step toward the closest broken window, and
said, "Maybe we should check if everything's all right."
</p><p align=left>Miriam placed a restraining hand on his shoulder.  "Whatever
happened, it's over now.  Anyway, this is Plague-Mort; don't
borrow other people's problems."
</p><p align=left>"But if someone is in trouble..."
</p><p align=left>"No," she told him.  "This is Rich Man's Row, Kid, the closest
thing this town has to a Nob Hill."  That in itself said volumes
about Plague-Mort, I thought.  The houses, even the ones
untouched by vandals, exhaled an air of decrepitude.  Roofs
sagged; cement footings were riddled with dark gummy cracks.
"The people who live here," Miriam went on, "can pay for
protection against normal cross-traders and bub-heads...which
means if a house like this gets smashed open, the Arch-Lector was
behind the job."
</p><p align=left>"What's an Arch-Lector?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"A fancy title for the head thug," Miriam replied.  "In a
slumtown like Plague-Mort, you can't just call yourself king.
Rulers need chi-chi titles: 'Viscount' or 'Rajah' or 'Holder of
the Sacred Sphere'.  All comes to the same thing, though--the guy
who tells his soldiers to break down your door if you've got
something he wants.  Whoever lived in this house had a pretty
wife, or a fast horse, or maybe just one piece of gold too many.
Tonight, the Arch-Lector decided to claim it for himself...and
unless you want to fight the local army, you'll mind your own
business."
</p><p align=left>"But the army isn't here anymore!" Hezekiah protested.
"They've taken what they want, right?  And if someone here is
hurt and needs our help..."
</p><p align=left>He didn't bother finishing his sentence, as if it was obvious
we should dash to the rescue.  I thought, Father would have
dashed in too; and he'd save the life of a beautiful woman who'd
be boundlessly grateful...the berk.
</p><p align=left>"Miriam," I said softly, "how long before the looters come?"
</p><p align=left>"At least a day," she answered.  "Even the greediest knight of
the post keeps clear of the Arch-Lector."
</p><p align=left>I nodded.  "Then for a day, this house could be a safe bolt-
hole."
</p><p align=left>"Sure," she admitted, "provided the Arch-Lector doesn't come
back in the morning to finish cleaning the place out."
</p><p align=left>"We can post a watch," Wheezle suggested.  "If the soldiers
return, they will make no effort at secrecy.  They have had their
fun with the first attack, ripping whoever lived here out of
their beds."  The gnome looked at the broken windows, the
smashed-in doors.  "If the soldiers left any corpses in there,
perhaps we could offer the proper obsequies..."
</p><p align=left>"In Plague-Mort," Miriam muttered, "the only last rites are
cleaning out a deader's pockets."  But she didn't stop the
Clueless boy from heading inside.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah went through the door.  If he'd had an open wound, he
would have ended up back in the Abyss--the door was a portal, and
blood was the key.  However, the lucky sod had survived the last
few days without so much as a paper cut, so he entered the house
without incident.  The rest of us went through a smashed-in
window, stepping down on splinters of broken glass that crunched
under the soles of our boots.  Rats skittered away from the
noise; in Plague-Mort, even the vermin watched their backs.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah sped toward the back of the house while Kiripao
bounded up the stairs to the top floor.  Sighing, the rest of us
split up to keep the two of them out of mischief...and I noticed
that Yasmin waited for me to head after Hezekiah before she chose
to follow Kiripao.
</p><p align=left>Anything to avoid me.
</p><p align=left>The house was dark, and we dared not light a lantern that
might be seen from the street.  Miriam and I stumbled through the
front room waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dimness.  All of
the furniture had been demolished, as well as a collection of
china that had once been displayed on plate-rails around the
ceiling.  The carpet smelled of urine; I supposed that had to be
blamed on the soldiers, determined to bespoil every inch of the
house...but I could not picture men doing such a thing.
</p><p align=left>Miriam noticed me sniffing at the odor.  "Hounds," she said in
a low voice.  "The Arch-Lector's troops call themselves the
Hounds.  Sometimes they go out of their way to act like dogs."
</p><p align=left>"Charming," I murmured.  "If I head into town I'll carry a
bucket of water, in case one goes for my leg."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The back half of the house contained the kitchen and servants'
quarters...although in Plague-Mort, those "servants" might
actually be slaves.  There was no way to determine their status
looking at their rooms now--after the Hounds had smashed, slashed
and thrown around slops, who could tell if these were the cozy
quarters of valued retainers or the squalid pens of chattel?
Whatever the servants might have been, they were gone now.  In
the darkness of the house, I couldn't tell if those smears on the
kitchen wall were blood or perhaps just gravy; but there were no
bodies here, living or dead.
</p><p align=left>"The smoke is coming from the basement," Hezekiah whispered in
a low voice.  He had just opened a door at the rear of the
kitchen, showing steps that descended into blackness.  Dank air
seeped up from below.
</p><p align=left>"Can you see down there?" I asked.  As a half-elf, Hezekiah
had better-than-human eyes when it came to poking around in the
dark.
</p><p align=left>"There's a tiny bit of light," he said, taking a few steps
down.  "Yes, over in the corner: the remains of a fire."
</p><p align=left>I ventured warily down the stairs after him.  In the
blackness, I could just make out the dull glow of embers, maybe
twenty paces away.  The smell of smoke was strong down here, and
suddenly that struck me as odd.  The Hounds hadn't lit fires
elsewhere in the house--they probably had orders from the Arch-
Lector not to burn a valuable property (and half the neighborhood
with it).  Why had they chosen to torch a small corner of the
cellar, and left the blaze untended?  Were they afraid of
something that had been here?
</p><p align=left>"Be careful," I whispered to Hezekiah ahead of me.  "Something
isn't right."
</p><p align=left>"There's nothing down here," he replied, approaching the
glowing coals.  "I'd be able to see the body heat of any warm-
blooded creature."
</p><p align=left>"That still leaves cold-blooded..."
</p><p align=left>At that instant, a gigantic snake rose amidst the remains of
the fire.  Hundreds of silvery spines lined its back, each spine
edged like a razor.  The serpent lifted itself a full six feet
into the air, hissing with rage...and in the dim light, I could
have sworn its head was that of a human woman.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah gave an incoherent yell, and suddenly disappeared:
the Clueless little berk had teleported away, and this time he'd
forgotten to take me.  "Nice snakey," I murmured in what I hoped
was a soothing voice.  "I'm not with those other guys.  What did
they do, set you on fire?  They're scum, but I'm not like that."
</p><p align=left>All through this speech, I was slowly moving my hand to the
pommel of my sword; but I froze when the snake spoke in a gentle
female voice.  "Please help me, good sir," she said.  And then
her upraised body toppled forward, slumping flat across the
burning coals.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>A moment later, Hezekiah reappeared behind me.  "Sorry," he
whispered.  "I jumped by reflex."  The boy glanced down at the
snake lying across the embers and said, "Looks like you didn't
need my help."
</p><p align=left>"I need it now," I told him.  "We have to get her away from
that fire."
</p><p align=left>"Are you nuts?" Hezekiah asked.  "Sorry...barmy?
</p><p align=left>"Just give me a hand, would you?"
</p><p align=left>Despite his misgivings, the boy followed me toward the snake.
She seemed unconscious now...which might have been a blessing,
given the burning coals under her torso.  I stepped into the
simmering ring, ignoring the smell of singed leather as my boots
began to smoulder.  Putting my hands under the snake was out of
the question, because of the bed of embers; but I could squeeze
the sides of her body enough to lift her off the ground, and then
get an arm underneath for support.
</p><p align=left>She was about nine feet long and heavy--two hundred pounds of
solid muscle--but between us, Hezekiah and I wrestled her away
from the fire and up the darkened stairs.  Scaly skin flaked off
liberally in our hands.  I hoped this was normal reptilian
shedding, but feared it was actually burned tissue ripping away
from her body.
</p><p align=left>Grunting and panting up the last few steps, Hezekiah gulped,
"Uncle Toby...says snake-meat...tastes like chicken.  Is that why
we're...Britlin, look at its head!"
</p><p align=left>Enough starlight filtered through the dirty kitchen windows to
show what had astonished the boy.  The snake did have a human
head: the face of a girl about twelve years old, soft and
vulnerable, with delicate green skin and long hair of burnished
gold.  True, she had two sharp fangs protruding from her mouth;
but they didn't negate the sweet gentleness of the rest of her
features.
</p><p align=left>"What is she?" Hezekiah breathed.
</p><p align=left>"A naga," I said, "one of the snake-people.  I've met a few
adults in Sigil, but never one this young.  She's just past her
first molt; while they're children, their heads don't look human
at all."
</p><p align=left>"What's she doing here?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't know.  Perhaps she was a pet...or a slave.  They're
as smart as most humans, and have magic abilities.  If you got
hold of an infant and raised her as a member of the family, she
could become a powerful asset."  I laid a hand on her cheek; the
flesh was cold, but I could feel her breath on my fingers.  "At
least she's still alive."
</p><p align=left>"But what do we do with her?"  The question came from Miriam
who stood in the kitchen doorway.  I didn't know where she'd been
for the past few minutes; possibly rummaging through other rooms
in search of removable goods.
</p><p align=left>"We treat her kindly," I replied.  "Some naga breeds are
innately malicious, but most are quite civilized."
</p><p align=left>"She's still a snake," Miriam grumbled, as if anything else
was irrelevant.
</p><p align=left>"Who's a snake?" Yasmin asked, coming in with Wheezle in her
arms.
</p><p align=left>"Her."  I pointed.  Even in the dim light, I could see
Yasmin's eyes grow bigger.
</p><p align=left>"She is a snake," Yasmin admitted.
</p><p align=left>"And she's waking up," Hezekiah said.
</p><p align=left>The naga's eyelids fluttered and a soft moan escaped her lips.
Miriam tensed and Hezekiah backed away; but I stayed put, hoping
she was too ladylike (and too weak) to use those wicked fangs.
</p><p align=left>"Who are you?" she whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Friends," I told her.  "My name is Britlin."
</p><p align=left>"My egg name is Zeerith," she replied.  "I must choose a tooth
name soon, but...I apologize.  I'm so tired."
</p><p align=left>"What happened here, Zeerith?" Yasmin asked gently.
</p><p align=left>"Men came," the naga answered.  "I don't know why.  I had been
downstairs for a day, enduring my...transformation.  The family
was very kind, giving me privacy--since they found me outside
town, they have always been kind."  She blinked, and a tear
beaded in the corner of one eye.  "Can you tell me what happened
to them?"
</p><p align=left>"Nothing good," Miriam muttered.
</p><p align=left>"I fear she is right, honored snakeling," Wheezle said.  "We
have searched the house and found it empty.  One can always
hope--"
</p><p align=left>"Not in Plague-Mort," Miriam cut him off.
</p><p align=left>Zeerith closed her eyes.  The lingering tear spilled down her
cheek.  "This is not a happy town," she murmured.  Opening her
eyes again, she said, "The soldiers thought I was an ordinary
snake.  They were cowardly men, too fearful to approach and see
what I was."
</p><p align=left>"Count yourself lucky," I told her.  "If they realized the
truth, you wouldn't be here now."
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps not," Zeerith nodded.  "As it was, they simply lit
burning sticks, then threw them at me until I played dead."
</p><p align=left>"Played dead!" Miriam snorted.  "I thought nagas could cast
magic."
</p><p align=left>"I do not know what I can do," Zeerith answered.  "I am
virtually new-born.  As the men pelted me with fire, I was still
in the final stages of molt.  I...pardon me, I feel so weak..."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin handed her a water flask.  It only contained brackish
water from the umbral village, but Zeerith drank it gratefully.
When the naga was finished, I eased her head down to the floor
and told her to rest.  Hezekiah stayed by her while I stood up to
talk with Yasmin and Miriam.
</p><p align=left>"So?" I said in a soft voice.
</p><p align=left>"There's no one in the house," Yasmin replied.  "I say we stay
here while Miriam finds this friend of hers...November, was that
the name?"
</p><p align=left>"And if the Hounds come back?" Miriam asked.
</p><p align=left>"We head out the back door and take Zeerith with us," Yasmin
replied.  "The Hounds will kill her if they find her; and she
can't go far on her own."
</p><p align=left>"Won't that look subtle," Miriam grimaced.  "The bunch of us
wandering the streets, carrying a boa constrictor."
</p><p align=left>I smiled and patted Miriam's shoulder.  "You still haven't got
the hang of this friendship thing, have you?"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Zeerith pleaded for more water.  Hezekiah found a rain barrel
in the house's back garden and fetched in a few quarts with a
soup cauldron.  As he was beginning to apply cold compresses to
the naga's burned skin, Hezekiah looked up and asked, "Where's
Kiripao?"
</p><p align=left>"Right behind me," Yasmin answered.  Then she turned and let
out an angry breath.  "Sod it, he's gone."
</p><p align=left>"He could just be lurking in shadows," I said.  "Yasmin,
search the house.  Hezekiah, you stay with Zeerith.  I'll have a
peek outside."
</p><p align=left>"Me, I'm going to find November," Miriam announced.  "That
piking Kiripao will stir up trouble, I can feel it in my bones.
Before that happens, I want an escape route back to Sigil."
</p><p align=left>"If we have to leave this house," I told her, "we'll head for
the closest inn."
</p><p align=left>She nodded and hurried out the front.  I looked through a
window into the back garden but didn't see any sign of Kiripao.
That left the street.  When I stepped onto the cobblestones,
Miriam was jogging away to the right so I went left, hoping that
one of us might catch sight of our missing ally.
</p><p align=left>Assuming, of course, that Kiripao still was our ally.  Since
the very beginning he hadn't been easy to trust; now, with the
umbral contagion infecting his mind, he might well turn stag on
us.  Would he stoop so far as to sic the Hounds on us?  Or would
he simply go berserk in the dark streets of Plague-Mort?
</p><p align=left>I reached a T-intersection, but saw nothing in either
direction.  Arbitrarily, I turned left again.  Halfway up the
street, I heard the far-off sounds of a tavern--a rumble of
conversation, bar wenches shouting orders to the tapman, and the
ragged muddle of inept musicians: drum, fiddle, and flute.  It
occurred to me Kiripao might be drawn to the flute's music, even
though it was nothing like the piping we'd heard from the
umbrals.  Crossing my fingers that the tavern wasn't some
killhole catering to vacationers from the Abyss, I pushed through
the pub's front door.
</p><p align=left>The place smelled of every staleness known to humanity: stale
sweat, stale beer, stale dreams.  Not that the place was
quiet--it was full of people in constant motion, shouting at each
other and playing cute with members of the appropriate sex.  What
was missing was the sense that anyone took delight in the frenzy.
When a patron pinched a passing barmaid, I saw no lust or teasing
lechery; it was simply something to do with his hands, some
meaningless gesture he'd learned a long time ago and was still
repeating because he knew no other tricks.  The whole thing
looked like a bar scene in the thousandth performance of a long-
running play...people going through rehearsed motions, their
minds disengaged and distant.
</p><p align=left>As in most pinch-crust taverns, the proprietor saw no need to
invest in over-many candles.  The back recesses were too dark to
inspect from the door, so I wove my way through the clutter of
tables and found some leaning space at the bar.  I put a coin
down on the counter and the tapman replaced it with a mug of
something foamy; but after one sip, I set the mug down with the
intention of never touching it again.  Perhaps somewhere in the
multiverse, a tavern owner has found a way to water ale that I
haven't tasted before...but this wasn't it.
</p><p align=left>I let my gaze roam around the room, searching for Kiripao.
He'd be lurking in the shadows, if he was here at all, but that
didn't make my job easier--the whole taproom was one big shadow,
and the constant movement of people running to the bar or privy
made it hard to check every face.  I had covered most of the left
half of the room when someone squeezed in on my right, calling to
the tapman, "A mug of your best for me and my friend!"
</p><p align=left>Idly, I turned my eyes to glance at the newcomers...then
looked away again, my blood running cold.  Leaning next to me at
the bar were a certain githyanki and githzerai: Qi and Chi,
Miriam had called them.
</p><p align=left>Don't go blubbery, I told myself.  They never saw you at the
City Courts, the Glass Spider, anywhere.  They don't know
you...and after traipsing through the Lower Planes so long,
you're just a dirty and unshaven cob like everyone else in the
room.  They won't give you a second glance, as long as you don't
go addle-coved.
</p><p align=left>I picked up my watery ale and had another sip after all; no
local pub-patron would leave without emptying his glass.  I'd
calmly finish my drink, then walk out the door.  If Kiripao was
hiding in a corner, he could sodding well look after himself.
</p><p align=left>Another sip, as unhurried as I could make my hand move.
Please let it be a coincidence Qi and Chi were here.  Miriam had
said people from the Glass Spider came to Plague-Mort for rest
and recreation; and this tavern was right on Rich Man's Row,
which meant it had to be one of the best in town.  I'd been here
five minutes and hadn't seen a fight yet--in a place like Plague-
Mort, that meant the ultimate in chic.  Come to think of it,
Miriam had recognized Rich Man's Row the second she walked
through the portal, so she must have spent time here.  Maybe the
portal from the Glass Spider came out in this neighborhood too.
Qi and Chi were merely here for a drink.
</p><p align=left>Or else they knew everything, and I'd get a poniard in the
back the moment I went outside.
</p><p align=left>I quaffed off the last of the beer, wiped my mouth in what I
hoped was typical Plague-Mort fashion, and eased away from the
bar.  There was a strong temptation to glance at Qi and Chi to
see if they were following; I resisted the urge.  Still, as I
ambled past tables of irritable customers, most simply looked up
in annoyance, then looked down again as soon as I passed.  Qi and
Chi couldn't be trailing along behind me--otherwise, there'd be
three people's worth of glaring instead of just me.
</p><p align=left>The doorknob was under my hand and I was building up to a sigh
of relief, when suddenly the latch snapped away from me.  I took
a step back, unnerved...and there, outlined in the doorway, stood
Kiripao.  He hissed softly and pointed at the musicians in the
corner of the room.  "The flute is mine."
</p><p align=left>"What are you talking about?" I whispered.
</p><p align=left>"The flute is mine, it's mine, it's mine."
</p><p align=left>"It is not," I told him.  "It probably doesn't even belong to
the flute player.  She's so bad, she must have found it in the
gutter on her way over."
</p><p align=left>"Have you no ears?" Kiripao hissed.  "She is playing
blasphemies."
</p><p align=left>"It sounds more like The Maiden and the Hungry Pigboy."  I put
my hand on his arm.  "Why don't you come along--"
</p><p align=left>He shrugged me off, glared at the flautist, and screamed,
"Blasphemer!"
</p><p align=left>"That's enough!" I said sharply...but the tavern had already
grown quiet behind me.  The small of my back itched at the
thought of Qi and Chi staring at us.  Even so, I couldn't turn
around--Kiripao might notice me look at them.  The two thieves
shouldn't recognize him, but the elf knew them well enough; he
had followed them back in Sigil, from the Mortuary to the
Vertical Sea.  If he caught sight of Rivi's two henchmen, I
didn't know what he'd do.  I just knew I didn't want him to do
it.
</p><p align=left>"You're coming with me," I told the elf with all the command I
could muster.  Since the tavern was silent, every patron
listening to our conversation, I added, "Your mother has been
distraught since you chewed your way out of the straitjacket.
Come home now, or Doctor Uvula will feed you more quicklime."
</p><p align=left>A few people behind me laughed.  That was good.
</p><p align=left>Brother Kiripao had no sense of humor.  That was bad.
</p><p align=left>I remember grabbing the collar of his robe and tugging him
toward the street.  I remember going, "Whoof!" as Kiripao's fist
connected with my solar plexus.  After that, I don't remember
much of anything, but I hope he hit me a few more times, and
maybe landed some flying drop-kicks to my head--it would be
embarrassing to get knocked out by a single punch.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The process of "coming to" spread itself over ten seconds:
first a muddy emergence of my brain, then other parts of my body
checking in to complain about how much they hurt.  Several ribs
spoke the loudest, followed by a diffuse throbbing around my left
cheek and eye.
</p><p align=left>There was a rough wooden floor beneath me, with splintered
furniture scattered all over it...and let me assure you, it
hadn't been the kind of furniture that splinters easily.  No
tavern in Plague-Mort, not even an upscale one in Rich Man's Row,
would buy bar stools that had to be replaced every time people
played fast and loose with their fists.  All the chairs, all the
tables, had been thick, heavy oak; and now they were thick, heavy
sticks of firewood, littering the floor around me.
</p><p align=left>Knowing it would hurt, I sat up.  Yep...it hurt.  I wasn't the
only person laid low by the brawl--unconscious bodies sprawled in
undignified poses everywhere I looked-- but I was the only one
moving at the moment, which I took as a tribute to my
constitution.  Perhaps I hadn't been out long at all; for one
thing, I still had my money-purse, which meant there hadn't been
time for thieves to go through my pockets.  It was still dark
outside too, as I could see through the open doorway: somehow,
the door had got knocked clean off its hinges.
</p><p align=left>I tried to struggle to my feet...but the moment I moved,
gravity suddenly increased by a couple hundred per cent, and I
sat down again abruptly.  Just what I expected in a place like
Plague-Mort: natural forces playing dirty tricks on me.  I
resolved to try again in the near future, this time leaping up
fast to catch gravity offguard; but seconds turned into minutes,
and the time never felt right.
</p><p align=left>A figure appeared in the doorway--a lean woman with bony
ridges protruding from her arms.  Sitting on the floor I waved to
her, then found that very funny for some reason and started to
giggle.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin?" she whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Hello," I said in a loud voice.  "Hello," I repeated more
softly, then wondered how it would sound in a deep voice.
"Hello," (deep bass).  "Hello," (falsetto).  "Hell-o-ohh!" (an
unsuccessful combination of both).
</p><p align=left>Yasmin knelt beside me.  "What are you doing here?"
</p><p align=left>"Having a concussion, that's what I'm doing."  Those were the
words in my mind; but all that came out of my mouth was a jumbled
syllables.  My incoherence struck me so funny, I laughed out
loud.  Flashes of purple light exploded in front of my eyes, with
a pain like a mace pummeling my head from the inside; but I
couldn't stop laughing, no matter how much it hurt.
</p><p align=left>"Shh," Yasmin said.
</p><p align=left>She laid a hand on my lips, then immediately jerked away
again.  I guessed she'd made some vow not to touch me, and I was
going to tell her how stupid that was as soon as I could remember
how to string words together intelligibly.  Another thought
struck me and I pulled myself together enough to say, "Qi and
Chi."
</p><p align=left>"Shh," she said again, as if I was babbling.
</p><p align=left>"Qi and Chi," I told her.  "Qi and Chi, Qi and Chi, Qi and
Chi-di-dee-di-dee."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin showed no sign of paying attention to my words.  She
looked around the ruined tavern as if one of the other
unconscious patrons might offer advice on what to do next; then
she slid a hand under my armpit and jerked me to my feet.  The
room spun and more of those purple flashes burst in front of my
eyes.
</p><p align=left>I remember thinking, If she gives me a good fast twirl, I
should feel something really worth remembering.  But she didn't.
The Doomguard can be so repressed.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Yasmin half-dragged me out of the tavern, my feet bouncing
along like a marionette's.  A few more crumpled bodies lay
outside on the cobblestones, but none I recognized.  Kiripao must
still be on the loose...as if Plague-Mort wasn't a dangerous
enough place already.  Qi and Chi were also gone; I wondered if
they had slipped away from the fight, or bashed in heads until no
one was moving.
</p><p align=left>All these thoughts seemed very lucid to me; and yet, when I
tried to speak to Yasmin again, all that came out was, "Qi Chi
there-there."  Even I had to admit that probably wasn't helpful
communication.
</p><p align=left>Perhaps to keep me quiet, Yasmin started talking herself.  "It
took me an hour to find you," she said in a low voice.  "The
town's quiet tonight--absolutely no one on the streets.  Maybe
people heard the Hounds were out on a raid, so they're staying
indoors."
</p><p align=left>"Rivi Qi Chi," I answered.  "Here, Rivi Qi Chi."
</p><p align=left>"Hush," she said, "you're delirious."
</p><p align=left>"Run, hide, Rivi Qi Chi--"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin clapped her hand over my mouth.  "No noise," she
whispered.  "The Hounds may prowling.  Please, Britlin,
please...don't talk."
</p><p align=left>She said those last words staring straight at me--the first
time she'd allowed me eye contact since the Sea of the Drowned.
I tried to meet her gaze clearly, despite the dizziness coating
my brain...tried to be the man she had kissed in the darkness of
the umbral village.  She must have seen something in my eyes
because she quickly turned away again, and whispered, "Don't."
</p><p align=left>I didn't say anything.  At the best of times, I probably
couldn't have found the right words.
</p><p align=left>After a while, she started helping me along again.  Without
looking at me, she murmured, "I told you I had a brother.  Well,
maybe two brothers if I count you...skip that.  My brother Jadon
was eight years older than me, and always in trouble.  Drinking,
gambling, bashing old bubbers for fun..."
</p><p align=left>She kicked at a pebble lying in the street.  It clattered over
the cobblestones, then splashed softly into the rain-filled
gutter.
</p><p align=left>"When I was ten," Yasmin went on, "my mother died.  Found
floating in the Ditch.  No one knew if it was suicide, murder, or
accident, and apart from me, no one cared.  After that, Jadon
'took care' of me.  You know what I mean?  My own brother.  Put
me on the streets at ten years old, and used me himself whenever
he felt like it."
</p><p align=left>I thought of my mother.  I shuddered.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin didn't notice.  "Four years of hell," she said.  "Until
one night, Jadon roughed up a woman who turned out to be a
succubus in disguise.  So much for Jadon; and praise The Lady for
making Sigil a city where such things can happen.  Anyway, I
joined the Handmaids of Entropy the same night, thinking they
would turn me into a remorseless killing machine...which is what
I dearly wanted to become at that moment.  I was all wrong about
how the Handmaids actually worshipped Entropy, but I was all
wrong about wanting to kill people too.  The Handmaids gave me
what I needed, and here I am.
</p><p align=left>"But Britlin...if you really are my brother, half-brother, I
can't let those old wounds open again.  I can't.  It's not your
fault, it's Jadon's...and maybe mine too, maybe it shouldn't make
a difference to me.  You and I were happy yesterday, why should
it make a difference?  But it does.  When I think that you might
be my brother, it wrenches my stomach and I feel so sick...I
can't breathe.  And the only reason I can even say this in front
of you is you don't understand a word."
</p><p align=left>She bent in and kissed my cheek, a kiss thick with good-bye.
Even as she continued to help me down the street, Yasmin had left
me--as surely as if she had stepped through a portal and
disappeared forever.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>In minutes we were back at the smashed-up house.  Hezekiah had
found an old wash-tub and Zeerith was dipping herself in it to
soothe the pain of her burns.  Her serpent's body was much too
long to fit inside the tub all at once, so she was immersing a
bit at a time, the rest of her body hanging out over the sides.
It looked uncomfortable, but the soaking had clearly eased the
pain on her gentle face.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle sat propped against one of the kitchen cupboards, his
hands folded placidly in his lap.  Missing a year from his life,
paralyzed from the waist down, he was still as tranquil as
death...but when the gnome caught sight of me, his eyes opened
wide and he cried, "Honored Cavendish!"
</p><p align=left>"I found him in the remains of a brawl," Yasmin said as she
lowered me to the floor.  "I don't know how Britlin got
involved...maybe Kiripao was there."
</p><p align=left>"Qi Chi," I told everyone.  "Rivi Qi Chi."
</p><p align=left>"He keeps saying that," Yasmin muttered.  "He must have a
concussion and it's making him delirious."  She let out an
exasperated snort.  "If it weren't for the sodding dust in my
lungs, I'd have the magic to heal him!"
</p><p align=left>"Is he very ill?" Zeerith asked softly.  The naga raised her
head three feet off the ground and gazed down at me as I slumped
on the floor.
</p><p align=left>"He's incoherent," Yasmin replied.  "Conscious but
incoherent...and that scares me.  Something's seriously wrong
with his brain."
</p><p align=left>I wanted to tell her I could think just fine; but my tongue
couldn't put the words together.  It occurred to me, maybe there
was something wrong inside my head--some rupture in the conduits
connecting thought and speech.  Very bad, very very bad.
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps," Zeerith murmured shyly, "I could..."  She lowered
her eyes in embarrassment.  "People have suggested I can work
magic, but I never...still, now that I have molted..."
</p><p align=left>"It is worth a try, honored snakeling," Wheezle said.  "And
perhaps we can offer you some small advice for focusing the
energy..."
</p><p align=left>"We'll help," Yasmin assured the naga.  "If you have the power
inside, we'll show you how to draw it out."
</p><p align=left>"This'll be great," Hezekiah enthused.  "A magic lesson!"
</p><p align=left>"Rivi Qi Chi," I said.  But nobody paid attention.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>With deep concentration, Zeerith stared into my eyes.  The
rest of her green-scaled body had coiled around me, not tightly
but with a firm grip that held me solid.  It took all my self-
control not to squirm--not just suppressing fear of being crushed
by a constrictor, but also a frisson of arousal at this embrace
from a girl just entered into womanhood.  You're delirious, I
told myself; such feelings are beneath you.  But her face was the
only thing I could see...her solemn, beautiful face meeting my
gaze with the intensity of a lover.
</p><p align=left>"Stay relaxed," Yasmin whispered in the naga's ear.  "Think of
a time when the world filled you with awe."
</p><p align=left>Zeerith bit her lip, a child's gesture.  "Do you want me to
talk about it?"
</p><p align=left>"If it will help you remember."
</p><p align=left>She closed her eyes, then opened them again, staring directly
at me...into me.  Her face was not just as beautiful as an angel,
it was equally profound.
</p><p align=left>"Years ago, when I was small," she began, "a storm struck the
town--not one of the fire storms that leaks over from the Bad
Place, but a rain storm, with a fierce and terrible wind.  That's
what I remember most, the wind: roaring through the streets,
rattling all the shutters, ripping leaves off the trees.  Candles
and lamps kept blowing out, even inside the house...because
drafts gusted through every chink, and the chimney sucked up a
steady breeze.  People ran about, trying to plug the holes, keep
the shutters from banging; and in the middle of it all, the front
door blew open right in front of me.  The open door, right there.
</p><p align=left>"I had never ventured into the street before.  The family told
me there were people out there who would hurt me; and I knew they
were telling the truth.  But the door was open, the street was
empty, the wind was blowing so hard that the rain made horizontal
streaks...and before I knew it, I was down the steps and sliding
along the cobblestones.
</p><p align=left>"The wind pulled at me, but I stayed low.  I stayed low.  And
the feel of the pavement was rough and wonderful against my
belly, the sting of the rain beating on my skin, the howl of the
wind tearing at the shingles of every roof...I was the only one
out that night.  Legged creatures would have been knocked off
their feet by the wind, but I could move freely.  I had the town
to myself.  The dark and stormy town, not a light to be seen.
</p><p align=left>"All mine."
</p><p align=left>Her voice was a whisper and her eyes shone.  She still gazed
at me, but I knew she was seeing the blackness of that gale-
battered night.
</p><p align=left>"You are touching the magic," Wheezle murmured.  "Now, invite
it into your soul."
</p><p align=left>He spoke so softly, I wondered if the naga even heard him.
Suddenly, however, the hairs of my skin bristled, tingling with
the presence of unseen energy.  Zeerith's eyes widened and her
mouth shaped into an O: surprise, wonder, awe.  Her breath caught
in a small gasp; then a creamy warmth gushed around me, pouring
out of her body, streaming from every scale.  It flooded into my
brain, so powerful it turned into a fiery pain, just for a
moment.  Purple flashes burst inside my eyes once more, a single
moment of explosion quickly dissipating into relaxed sparkles.
</p><p align=left>Zeerith's body loosened around me and slumped to the floor.
Yasmin leapt forward to prevent the girl's head from slamming
down; but the naga stopped herself without help and offered a
weak smile.  "Was that magic?" she asked.
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I told her.  "I assure you it was magic."  For the
briefest of seconds, I let my fingers twine quietly through her
hair.  Then I forced myself away.  "Thank you, but now we have to
get out of here.  Qi and Chi are in the area; it's not safe to
stay in one place."
</p><p align=left>"Sod it all!" Yasmin growled.  "That's what you meant by Rivi
Qi Chi?"
</p><p align=left>"That's what I meant.  Let's get moving before--"
</p><p align=left>"Hello, my wee darlings," called a gloating voice from the
street.  "Have you missed me?"
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="16"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
16. THREE SOUND SLEEPERS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>"Grab Wheezle!" I shouted to Yasmin.  Then in a much quieter
voice I asked Hezekiah, "How many people can you teleport at
once?"
</p><p align=left>"I've never tried more than two," he answered, "but I should
be able to...gahhhhh!"
</p><p align=left>The boy keeled over, squealing and pressing his hands to his
face.  "She's trying to blank me again!" he shouted.  "I hate
this!"
</p><p align=left>"Fight it," I growled as I snatched up a heavy crockpot lying
on the floor.  "I'll try to break her concentration.  If you get
a chance to port the others out of here, don't wait for me."
</p><p align=left>Without giving time for an answer, I sprinted into the dark
front room of the house.  Through the broken windows, I could see
the damned albino standing outside on the cobblestones, her face
more painted than ever: crimson stripes down one cheek like claw
marks, and blue bands radiating out like spokes around both eyes.
She still wore that filmy sheath of black silk, sheer enough to
reveal intimate details of her flawless body beneath; yet the
sight aroused nothing in me but the ardent desire to bludgeon her
slaggish skull with the crockpot in my hand.
</p><p align=left>Rivi held her fingertips lightly to her temples, eyes half-
shut as she tried to crush her way into Hezekiah's brain.  Wights
flanked her left and right, at least a dozen of them; I didn't
stand a chance of getting close to her.  Still, I had a clear
shot for heaving the pot straight at her face...and I only spent
a moment taking aim before I hurled it through the broken window.
</p><p align=left>The pot sped swift and true, too fast for the clumsy wights to
react...but as the crockery hurtled through the darkness, a blur
of motion intercepted it, smashing it to the ground mere inches
in front of Rivi's feet.  The blur snapped around to block any
more projectiles that might fly out of the building; and I saw it
was Kiripao, a look of ecstasy on his face.
</p><p align=left>"Peel it off," he said, staring straight at me.  "Peel away
the shell."
</p><p align=left>With one fluid motion, he tucked a toe under the lip of the
crockpot and kicked it back at me with the speed of a cannonball.
I dove for the floor; the wind from the passing pot whisked
coldly against my neck.  A moment later, plaster spattered around
my legs as the pot gouged a chunk from the wall behind me.
</p><p align=left>Expecting Kiripao himself to barrel through the window any
second, I whipped out my sword and rolled to my feet.  He might
be fast, but I had the advantage--he'd have to land gingerly to
avoid the broken glass on the floor, giving me time to impale him
straight through the heart.  The question was, could I really do
it?  I'd never really liked Kiripao, but he'd been on our side to
begin with.  Even if he worked for the enemy now, he wasn't
responsible for his actions: the umbrals had infected him with
their twisted mentality, and perhaps Rivi had done some tinkering
too.  Did Kiripao deserve to die?
</p><p align=left>No.  He didn't.  But I'd kill him anyway if he came through
that window.  When a dog goes mad, you don't have a choice.
</p><p align=left>I waited, forcing myself not to hold my breath.  He'd come
through the window, or maybe the broken-down door.  I stood where
I had a clear path to each, a single step forward and the killing
thrust.  Seconds trickled by; and then a wail came from the
kitchen, Hezekiah cursing, "Damn, damn, damn, she did it to me
again!  I'm completely blanked."
</p><p align=left>"You really have to work on your willpower, darling," Rivi
called from the street.  "You're a dear wee child, but you don't
have the instinct for blood.  Too soft.  Too...undirected."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah shouted back, "I'll 'direct' you if I get my hands on
you."
</p><p align=left>"That's the spirit," Rivi laughed.  "Focus on hatred and
vengeance; you'll be as strong as me in no time.  Of course,
that's precisely what you have: no time."
</p><p align=left>"How'd you find us, Rivi?"  That was Yasmin, asking a question
I would have asked myself, except that I didn't want to give away
my position.
</p><p align=left>"Your friend Kiripao has been an utter dear," Rivi replied.
"He met two of my colleagues in a drinking establishment not far
from here.  Picked them out of the crowd, walked right up, and
told them precisely where you were.  I'd say that he sold you
out, except that he's not interested in monetary reward."
</p><p align=left>"Peel them," Kiripao cried.  "Peel them all!"
</p><p align=left>Rivi chuckled.  "Apparently he's developed some fascinating
ideas on how to free your souls from their wee prisons of flesh.
He cares about you, he really does; he sees himself as your
personal liberator."
</p><p align=left>This last statement prompted Kiripao to make a whuffling
sound, like a bear slavering over a carcass.  Perhaps the sound
was laughter...or weeping.
</p><p align=left>"Now, darlings," said Rivi, "far be it from me to interfere
with a monk enlightening his flock; but I could try to restrain
him, if you showed a wee bit of cooperation.  Give me the
grinder, right here, right now, and I guarantee we'll all walk
away from this, whistling tunes of cheer."
</p><p align=left>"I can't whistle," Hezekiah snapped back, in what he must have
thought was a brilliant retort.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle said in a low voice, "Once the honored madwoman gets
through, you'll whistle any tune she wants."
</p><p align=left>"I don't have to be nice about this," Rivi called.  "I have
enough wights to take what I want by force.  But Plague-Mort is
such a dear wee town, it makes me sentimental to a fault.  Why
don't I give you a count of ten?  One...isn't this exciting?
Two...no, it isn't.  Ten.  Sorry, I got bored."
</p><p align=left>That's when the wights charged en masse.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>I don't know what instructions Rivi had given the
wights--probably to fight their way inside and kill anyone who
resisted.  Whatever she told them, the nasty wee albino still
hadn't realized her hate-filled slaves yearned to pervert the
intention of her commands; or perhaps, Rivi was so used to being
loathed that she no longer gave it any thought.  She certainly
hadn't told the wights to exercise any useful tactics, like a
two-pronged attack through window and door.  Instead, the wights
simply swarmed forward, claws swinging, throats hissing, until
they collided with the front wall of the building...then they
took out the wall.
</p><p align=left>It didn't happen all at once.  A dozen sets of claws smashed
the building simultaneously, stabbing through the wood exterior
and the plaster inside.  I could see individual fingers piercing
the wall in front of me, talons flexing.  In unison, the fingers
clenched into fists and pulled backward with supernatural
strength.  Plaster broke off in handfuls...and with a groaning of
rusty nails, board after board ripped off the front of the house,
leaving long horizontal gaps.  It took the wights a few moments
to shake off the lumber still clinging to their fingers; then
their hands crashed out in unison again, like claw-tipped
battering rams.
</p><p align=left>You know, I thought to myself, in a normal town, bar fights,
prowling monsters, and a house being demolished by the undead
would eventually catch the attention of the city watch.  But in
beautiful Plague-Mort, pearl of the Outlands...
</p><p align=left>The wights heaved and ripped off another bunch of boards.  It
was a riveting visual effect, strips of the house being ripped
away to let lamplight glimmer through: lamplight choked with
plaster dust and twinkling off the broken glass on the floor.  A
painting of that would sell very well to an Anarchist...not that
most Anarchists had money, of course, but there must be some
prominent merchants who were secretly Anarchist sympathizers...
</p><p align=left>"Are you going to stand there and let them tear the house
apart?" Yasmin demanded.
</p><p align=left>"Sorry," I murmured, collecting my thoughts.  "I was just
contemplating the beauties of Entropy."
</p><p align=left>She looked at me narrowly, debating whether I was mocking her
beliefs.  Before she could come to a conclusion I'd regret, I
said, "Let's get busy, shall we?" and lifted my sword.
</p><p align=left>Truth to tell, wights whacking the wall of one's only refuge
might look sodding scary, but the house was built to withstand
hurricanes like the one Zeerith had described; the undead were
still a long way from collapsing the place, or even clawing their
way inside.  All they'd really done was rip out the horizontal
equivalent of arrow slits: four-inch wide holes, ideal for
stabbing swords out at attackers.  Even better, as soon as the
wights rammed their talons into the wood again, they were as good
as handcuffed, like condemned prisoners waiting for the axe.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin and I gladly played their executioners.
</p><p align=left>I took out two the first time: a pair of quick thrusts, both
through rotting faces, the jabs hard enough to drive bone chips
liberally through the wights' brains.  The first one fell without
a sound.  The second had enough time to spit a hiss of rage; then
my rapier plunged straight between its eyes, pithing whatever
last thoughts such a creature might have.
</p><p align=left>The other wights tore away a few more boards; but the monsters
Yasmin and I dispatched only slumped where they were, their claws
still deeply imbedded in the wall.  I wished I could see them
from the street--a group of dead wights dangling from the front
of the house by their hands, their heads skewered and spilling
out brains.
</p><p align=left>A nice score, I thought to myself.  If Yasmin and I both
killed two wights with every assault, we'd soon whittle down the
opposition to just Rivi and Kiripao...and Qi and Chi, of course,
wherever they were.
</p><p align=left>Sod it all...where were Qi and Chi?
</p><p align=left>The wights slammed forward again...and even as I cleaved the
heads of two more, my thoughts raced in other directions.  Why
had Rivi let the wights make another charge?  She'd seen how
easily we could kill them.  No doubt she had more wights back at
the Glass Spider, but they weren't here now.  And where were Qi
and Chi?  Two sneak thieves who had robbed faction headquarters
in Sigil while the defenders were kept busy with a diversion...
</p><p align=left>"Sod it, she's peeling us," I growled.  In a low voice, I
said, "Yasmin, you deal with the wights.  I have to check on the
others."
</p><p align=left>Still cursing, I dashed toward the kitchen.  Breaking into
this house would be child's play for experienced thieves: over
the back wall into the garden, then a short sneak up to the
kitchen door.  If the others had their attention focussed on the
fight out front, they wouldn't notice Qi and Chi till much too
late.
</p><p align=left>And it was too late.  Even before I reached the kitchen I
heard the sound of snoring--Hezekiah's snore, something I'd heard
often enough since we began keeping vigil outside the Sigil
Mortuary.  The Clueless boy certainly wouldn't fall asleep in the
middle of a battle, even if someone else was doing the fighting;
indeed, I should have been suspicious when he didn't come running
to gawk at the wights.  Slowing down, I walked the last few paces
to the kitchen door as quietly as I could, trusting that the
banging and hissing from the street would cover whatever little
noise my boots made.
</p><p align=left>My father could probably list all the ways of putting people
to sleep against their will--spells, magic powders, potions and
vapors--but my only knowledge of the subject came from the penny
dreadfuls I read as a teenager.  In those stories, both heroes
and villains had infallibly effective ways of knocking each other
out, ones that never made you vomit afterward, never gave
concussions, never killed people with weak hearts.  I stopped
reading penny dreadfuls when I stopped believing in such wondrous
tricks, but clearly I'd done the books an injustice...Qi and Chi
had apparently put Hezekiah, Wheezle, and Zeerith to sleep as
easily as snuffing out a candle.
</p><p align=left>Boy, gnome, and naga all lay on the floor, limp and peaceful.
Qi and Chi were already inside the room, one of them rummaging
through our backpacks while the other stood guard with a
crossbow.  Luckily for me, the guard had to divide his attention
between the front and back doors of the kitchen; and at the
moment I peeked around the corner, he was looking out into the
garden.  I ducked out of sight again immediately.
</p><p align=left>All right, Britlin, think.  Rivi sent the thieves to steal the
dust grinder while the wights kept us busy in front.  I could
simply let the bad guys take the piking grinder and hope Rivi
would leave us alone once she got what she wanted; or I could try
to stop them, hope I won the fight, and hope we could still get
out of Plague-Mort with our skins intact.  One hope to two--a
gambler would say that letting them walk off with the grinder was
the safer bet.
</p><p align=left>On the other hand, no self-respecting Sensate ever made safety
his first priority...
</p><p align=left>The Hounds had scattered plenty of debris during their raid.
Close to hand were numerous pieces of ripped clothing, the
smashed remains of a wooden chair, and an oil painting with its
canvas slashed.  From what I could see, the painting hadn't been
much of a treasure--a bad approximation of a woman looking at an
even worse version of her face in a mirror--but its gold-leafed
frame was sturdy and solid, rendered with admirably detailed
curlicues.  Flat and heavy, it would fly like a discus, at least
over the short distance between me and the thief with the
crossbow.  If it stopped him from plugging me with that arrow,
the painting would have served a more useful purpose than most
abstract art.
</p><p align=left>A deep breath in.  A slow breath out.  Then I leaned around
the corner and whipped the painting at the bowman with all the
strength I could muster.
</p><p align=left>The frame struck him hard, one corner burying its point into
his solar plexus.  His breath whoofed out and his trigger finger
on the bow must have jerked in pained reaction--the arrow snapped
away from the bow with a crack, glancing off the closest wall,
and digging into one of the cupboards.  Even before it had
chunked home, I was crossing the gap between me and the bowman,
shouting at the top of my lungs in the hope of jolting him.  It
didn't work; before I got close enough for a slash with my
rapier, he had raised the bow to block, knocking my blade away
from a killing stroke.
</p><p align=left>"Qi!" he shouted...or maybe "Chi!", it was hard to tell.  Not
that he needed to alert his partner to my presence--I'd made
enough noise to wake the undead, though my sleeping companions
continued to snore placidly.  Any moment now, the other thief
would enter the fray, probably with a crossbow of his own; and my
current target only had to parry my thrusts until I took an arrow
through the heart.
</p><p align=left>You wouldn't think a crossbow made an effective fencing
weapon; and in more appropriate conditions, it wouldn't have.
However, the kitchen was dark, its floor was littered with easy-
to-trip-over rubbish, and I was doing everything I could to keep
my target (the githyanki) between me and his fellow thief--the
last thing I wanted was to give the githzerai a clear shot at me.
All these complications prevented me from delivering any
swordplay worth the name...which meant that thrust after thrust
got deflected by the crossbow's wooden body.  Even worse, it was
just a matter of time before my blade bit too deeply into the
wood.  If my sword got stuck, the githyanki would leap on me
instantly, scrabbling to take me apart with his bare hands.
</p><p align=left>An arrow buzzed past my ear--the thief at the far end of the
room had taken a shot at me, despite his partner in the way.  I
wondered if a fragment of his racial instincts remained, despite
Rivi's tinkering with his mind: the githzerai hatred of
githyanki, secretly delighted if his bolt went awry and took the
githyanki in the back.  Perhaps he simply thought he could hit
me...and he came piking close, near enough that I felt the
arrow's wind.  If I gave the berk time to reload, I wouldn't be
so lucky the next time.
</p><p align=left>Still, what could I do?  The githyanki in front of me had
reflexes like an eel, swiping aside my every strike.  He had a
smile on his ugly face, almost as if he was playing with me--as
if he knew he could hold me off for as long as he needed.
Perhaps he could have too, if he hadn't made the mistake of
stepping too close to Wheezle's small body.
</p><p align=left>The gnome wasn't really asleep: he'd just been playing possum,
biding his time for the moment when a magicless paraplegic could
make a contribution.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle reached out, grabbed the githyanki's ankle, and bit
hard into the thief's fleshy leg.
</p><p align=left>The githyanki opened his mouth as if to yell from the pain.
It looked like a target to me...and I jabbed forward with an all-
or-nothing thrust, the tip of the blade punching through the roof
of his mouth and straight into the hind-brain.  His body jerked
in a violent spasm, dancing uncontrollably on the end of my sword
as muscles were suddenly freed from the mind's command; then he
slumped into dead-weight, dragging my rapier down until he slid
slickly off the blade.
</p><p align=left>"Thanks, Wheezle," I sighed.
</p><p align=left>"A pleasure to serve, honored Cavendish."
</p><p align=left>"When this is all over," I said, "tell me what his leg tasted
like."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>I leapt the crumpled body of the githyanki, prepared to plunge
my sword into his githzerai partner.  What I wasn't prepared for
was a ram-force gusher of white dust smashing me in the chest.
It knocked me backward like a mace, and I tripped over the corpse
I'd just killed; Wheezle barely got out of the way as I fell
heavily to the ground.  Then the dust spray struck again, sending
me, the gnome, and the githyanki corpse skittering across the
trash-strewn floor.  Pans clattered as we smashed into them, and
silver cutlery, knives and forks, were swept up by the hurricane
of dust to slap against our faces.
</p><p align=left>"The githzerai has found the grinder," Wheezle observed, as
the spray slammed us into the wall.
</p><p align=left>"So how," I said, choking on dust, "can the sodding thing have
so much kick without a speck of recoil?"
</p><p align=left>"It was made by gods," Wheezle replied, "and gods despise
physical law.  They regard action/reaction as a personal affront,
and defy it whenever they can."
</p><p align=left>All this time, of course, I was attempting to squirm to my
feet.  The effort was fruitless: whenever I managed to get my
legs underneath me, the spray simply bashed me down again.  Dust
clogged the air, pooling up an ever-increasing mound on the
floor.  I covered my face with my coat-tail, just for the chance
to breathe something other than white powder; but the dust kept
pelting down, burying me like a Pharaoh.
</p><p align=left>Long seconds passed.  At last, I realized the pressure from
the spray had eased and I heaved myself up, scattering a haze of
dust around me.  Emerging from the cloud, I saw the githzerai was
gone, fled out the back door.  I ran in pursuit, but when I
reached the garden there was no sign of him--he must have hopped
it over the fence, and I had no delusions about catching such a
speedy runner in the twisting lanes of Plague-Mort.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle came crawling toward me, pulling himself across the
dust-heaped floor.  He looked up at me, saw my expression and
said, "We're piked?"
</p><p align=left>I nodded.  "We are completely, totally piked."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Wheezle stayed in the kitchen to wake up Hezekiah and Zeerith,
while I hurried out front again to check on Yasmin.  She was
still in one piece, her sword blade covered with clots of hair
and cerebellum.  "I'm worried," she said as I entered the room.
"All this wight-fighting...it's making me dependent on head-
shots.  I mean, spearing a wight through the heart isn't an
instant kill, so a head-shot is the most effective approach.
Still, I worry about getting into the habit of avoiding the body,
when really, in most opponents...I'm babbling, aren't I?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes, Yasmin."
</p><p align=left>"How are things in the kitchen?"
</p><p align=left>"It looks like the cook spilled some flour."
</p><p align=left>Her forehead wrinkled.  "What does that mean?"
</p><p align=left>"It means Rivi got what she wanted."
</p><p align=left>With so many boards ripped off the front of the house, I could
easily see out into the street.  Only one wight was left,
standing on one side of Rivi while Kiripao stood on the other.
The ice-skinned woman faced our direction, but her glittering
eyes were distant, focussed far elsewhere.  As I looked at her,
she suddenly straightened up and smiled.
</p><p align=left>"Darlings!" she called, "my wee githzerai pal tells me he's
got away with the grinder.  What fabulous news!  My business here
is done."
</p><p align=left>I shouted, "Where do you think you're going?"
</p><p align=left>"O, dear heart, I'm bound for Sigil.  I told what fun I'll
have there--all those wizards and priests, who think they're
protected by magic.  Can't you imagine the looks on their faces
when they can't cast a single spell without burning to cinders?
And then I'll claim their minds."
</p><p align=left>"You're barmy," Yasmin told her.  "The Lady of Pain will never
let you into Sigil with those two grinders."
</p><p align=left>"That's where you're wrong," Rivi smirked.  "The grinders are
older than the gods, older than The Lady, older than the most
ancient barriers guarding Sigil.  I've heard our quiff modern
deities can't even sense the grinders-- that's why you could
carry them through the Lower Planes without infernal powers
trying to steal them.  The most powerful forces of antiquity made
the grinders invisible to divine eyes...which means that The Lady
won't know what I'm doing till it's too late."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin whispered to me, "We have to get out of here, Britlin.
We have to warn someone what this slag is up to."
</p><p align=left>"I know."  But secretly, I was gauging how fast I could reach
the gloating albino: through the door, into the street, across
the cobblestones.  Could I reach her before the wight and Kiripao
stopped me?  Not likely; she was just too piking far away.
</p><p align=left>"Time to say good-bye," Rivi announced.  "I have ever so much
work planned out.  Things to do, people to brainwash...in the
meanwhile, however..."
</p><p align=left>She chuckled.  It was definitely not a chuckle to make
children sleep smiling in their beds.  Then she clapped her
hands, and suddenly a stream of new wights poured around the
corner: ten of them, twenty, thirty, and more, all of them racing
forward with that peculiar arm-swinging gait, their eyes aflame
with crimson fire.
</p><p align=left>"Have fun, my darlings," Rivi said with a cheery wave.  "I
don't think we'll see each other again."
</p><p align=left>Then she was gone, Kiripao covering her withdrawal as more and
more wights filled the street.  I could see lamplight glint off
their pointed teeth.  Then, in a rush, they struck the front of
the house like a tsunami.
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="17"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
17. THREE MILES THROUGH THE OUTLANDS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>When there had only been a dozen wights clawing at the wall,
the house stood up well against the destruction.  With the
demolition team multiplied threefold however, the building quaked
at the very impact of so many talons smashing into the wood.
Yasmin and I leapt forward, eliminating two attackers each; but
the remaining undead heaved with such force, the entire wall
ripped away in a solid flat.  It wobbled in the wights' grip, two
storeys high and shaken by the brisk wind that blew through the
streets of the town.  The wights tried to keep it upright, but
they had no leverage.  Slowly, the top of the facade tipped back,
farther and farther, until a sudden breezy gust blew it <SLAM>
against the house on the opposite side of the street.
</p><p align=left>The collision was the last straw for the poor battered wall.
The lower storey, torn to tatters by previous wight attacks,
broke apart completely, a wagon-load of lumber thunking down
around the wights' ears.  Then the upper story dropped in a
single piece, like a great fly-swatter slapping down in a cloud
of shattering plaster.  Every wight was knocked to the ground,
buried under the mass of wood.
</p><p align=left>Silence descended, broken only by soft, ominous creaks from
the ceiling sagging over our heads.  Yasmin stepped forward,
staring out the open hole where a wall had once separated the
house from the street.  She peered at the tangle of timber heaped
over the wights and whispered, "Do you think that crushed them?"
</p><p align=left>In answer, the mound of boards exploded upward, wood flying in
all directions as undead muscles threw off the clutter.  Planks
whizzed in our direction, forcing us to duck; other boards
smashed through windows of neighboring houses, or thunked heavily
along the pavement.  In a moment, an army of wights stood intact
on the cobblestones, teeth gleaming, eyes filled with blazing
hate.
</p><p align=left>The wall was gone.  There was nothing separating them from us.
</p><p align=left>"Fight or flee?" Yasmin asked, lifting her sword.
</p><p align=left>"If we flee, they'll just catch us in the back garden," I told
her.  "We can't all get over the fence in time."
</p><p align=left>"But if we fight," Yasmin said, "the others have a chance to
get away."
</p><p align=left>"Let's make it a last stand in the kitchen," I suggested.
"The Tooth Guild here can only come through the door one by one."
</p><p align=left>"Until they rip out that wall too."
</p><p align=left>"Don't give them ideas," I growled.  "Now we'll just back
away."
</p><p align=left>For our first two steps backward, the wights did nothing--just
fixed their burning gaze on us with a palpable intensity.  At our
third step, one wight hissed; immediately, all the others took up
the sound, a harsh rush of breath cutting across the midnight
wind.
</p><p align=left>"Time for a strategic withdrawal?" Yasmin suggested.
</p><p align=left>"I'd prefer to run like a son-of-an-orc."
</p><p align=left>So we ran, an army of undead at our heels.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Out the back!" I shouted to the others as Yasmin and I
hurtled into the kitchen.
</p><p align=left>"What's the problem?" Hezekiah asked, his voice thick with
sleep.
</p><p align=left>A wight stuck its head through the door.  Yasmin cut it off.
</p><p align=left>"Oh, them again," Hezekiah said.  He heaved Wheezle into his
arms, and nudged a yawning Zeerith with his foot.  "Time for us
to go."
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps," said the naga, "I should stay and fight.  If I have
magic..."
</p><p align=left>I looked down at her sleek body, now coated in a flouring of
the white dust that layered the whole kitchen.  "The magic's
gone," I told her.  "Wheezle will explain on your way out."
</p><p align=left>Two more wights charged at the door.  I took left, Yasmin took
right, all the while yelling to our companions, "Run!"
</p><p align=left>Then there was no time to think about anything but the undead
surging toward us like a hissing ocean.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Within seconds, we had six wight carcasses piled in front of
the door--enough to form a rampart that kept the other monsters
at a disadvantage.  They still shuffled forward, trying to push
down the wall of bodies and shove their way inside; but with a
flurry of jabbing and stabbing, Yasmin and I held the line
against them.
</p><p align=left>Minutes passed: long, tiring minutes of constant fighting.  I
didn't know if wights felt fatigue, but I was on the verge of
exhaustion.  My swordplay had turned sloppy...and my mind was
clear enough to recognize the degradation in technique, without
being able to sharpen up.  Claws whisked by my face, coming close
enough to tear at my jacket; and the smell of rotting flesh
filled the kitchen, biling my stomach with nausea.
</p><p align=left>"Maybe..." Yasmin panted, "we should try...to escape after
all."
</p><p align=left>"You think...you can move enough...to run?"
</p><p align=left>"No."
</p><p align=left>Her reply was almost drowned out by the hissing of wights.
They could smell victory.
</p><p align=left>"Yasmin..." I began.  "If we're going to die...let me just
say--"
</p><p align=left>"Don't!" she cried.  "You'll break my heart."
</p><p align=left>I closed my mouth and found enough strength to lop off the arm
of a wight reaching for me.  The amputated stump spurted red
dust; the arm, dropping like a dead-weight, continued to clench
its fingers, futilely trying to grab at something.  "I know how
you feel," I told the fallen hand.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's mouth turned up in a small grin.  "Sentimental berk,"
she said, trying to hide the smile.  Then she tucked a toe under
the cut-off arm and kicked it back into the scrum of undead...
</p><p align=left>...which for some reason had eased off their mob action at the
kitchen door.  Indeed, they were snarling up a storm of hisses,
but not aimed at us--every wight had turned to face the street,
and some were already shuffling in that direction, brandishing
their claws in a ready-for-business way.
</p><p align=left>"What now?" Yasmin whispered.
</p><p align=left>"Now the wights try to kill whoever's coming down the street,
while we sneak out the back."
</p><p align=left>"But if it's Miriam and her friend out there--"
</p><p align=left>"They have a fair chance of outrunning the wights," I
interrupted, "while we have no hope of fighting through thirty
undead to help them.  Let us hie ourselves hence, good woman,
before the monsters remember we're here."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin didn't look happy about leaving the fight before all
the enemy was dead--typical Doomguard--but I nudged her gently
toward the door and eventually she started moving.  Part of her
resistance may have been simple fatigue; she could barely keep
her swordpoint off the floor.
</p><p align=left>We both held our weapons at weary ready as we backed into the
garden and the chill Plague-Mort night.  Frost was beginning to
whiten on the grass, making it easy to see the slithering trail
from Zeerith crossing the yard.  I wondered how she would react
to the cool weather...if she hibernated like other cold-blooded
animals.  For the time being, however, she was clearly moving
fast and strong; I couldn't guess how she climbed over the garden
wall, but the marks in the frost showed she had succeeded without
fuss.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin and I weren't fresh enough to scale the wall so
easily--it was six feet of solid brick, topped by a row of
spikes--but we found enough footholds to clamber over awkwardly
and lower ourselves down the other side.  Hezekiah was waiting
for us, a beaming smile on his homely face.  "You made it!" he
cried.  "Did you kill all the wights?"
</p><p align=left>Yasmin gave a snort of a laugh.  "They let us go," she told
him.  "Something else grabbed their atten--"
</p><p align=left>The wall stood between us and the house, but we could still
see a sudden flare of crimson light dazzle the sky.  A moment
later came the muffled <CRUMP> of an explosion.  After our
experiences of the past week, I had no trouble recognizing a
fireball blast...landing, I would guess, in the midst of the
wights who filled the house's living room.
</p><p align=left>"What was that?" Hezekiah gulped, eyes wide.
</p><p align=left>"Someone must be fighting the wights," Yasmin replied.  "Maybe
the Hounds have finally shown up."
</p><p align=left>"Can the Hounds shoot fireballs?" Hezekiah asked.
</p><p align=left>"They can now," a new voice said.
</p><p align=left>Miriam stepped from the shadows, accompanied by a gray-skinned
woman in her mid-twenties: a striking beauty with high cheek
bones and glossy red hair, the kind a man would be happy to bed
if he could figure out how to work around the scaly wings that
sprouted from her back.  The wings were tiny in comparison to the
rest of the woman, less than two feet high, with an equally short
span; but I had no doubt they could carry her far and fast if the
need arose.  The Planes are like that--out here, even the most
vestigial wings can fly.
</p><p align=left>"This is the guide I told you about," Miriam said, gesturing
toward the winged woman.  "Her name's November."
</p><p align=left>"And what race are you?" Hezekiah piped up cheerfully.
</p><p align=left>His question was greeted with frosty silence from November,
and embarrassed shuffling of feet from the rest of us.  Finally,
November said in a chilly voice, "There are some things you don't
ask strangers, unless you like floating face down in the nearest
sewage pond."
</p><p align=left>"I was just trying to learn," he protested.  "How will I learn
if I don't ask?"
</p><p align=left>November's eyes narrowed.  "The multiverse does not care
whether or not you learn.  The multiverse does not care whether
or not you live.  Only people care, and precious few of them.  Do
you hear me?"
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah gulped.  "Okay.  Sorry."
</p><p align=left>"Apology accepted," November answered evenly.  "And because I
know you will make a nuisance of yourself, constantly staring and
wondering what I am, I shall tell you I was born the child of a
human man and a hell-spawned succubus.  Some like to call my kind
alu-fiends, but I do not want to hear that word cross your lips.
You will call me an alu; my father raised me to suppress the
fiendish aspects of my soul, and his spirit would grieve if I
were forced to kill you over mere terminology."
</p><p align=left>"Alu," Hezekiah nodded.  "A good old alu.  Got it."
</p><p align=left>He continued bobbing his head like a berk until a scowl from
November stopped him.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>On the other side of the wall, another explosion raked the
sky, followed by a cracking of timbers.  Any second, I thought
I'd hear the entire house collapse; but the carpenters of Plague-
Mort had clearly surpassed themselves in building the place.
After two fireballs, an army of wights, and the earlier invasion
by Hounds, the house remained standing--on fire now, but still
mostly upright.
</p><p align=left>"What is happening?" Zeerith asked, an edge of panic in her
voice.
</p><p align=left>"Hounds versus wights," Miriam replied.  "Pity we can't go out
front and watch."
</p><p align=left>"I've seen fireballs before," I said.  "Unless, of course, the
Hounds have some new, more interesting kind..."
</p><p align=left>"Standard stuff," Miriam answered with a dismissive wave of
her hand.  "I happened to know where the Fox stashed a few
firewands, right here in town.  They came in handy for bribes."
</p><p align=left>"Not bribes," November bristled, holding up two wands of her
own.  "Payment for services to be rendered."
</p><p align=left>Miriam shrugged.  "You got payment, the Hounds got bribes."
She turned back to me.  "I gave the Arch-Lector's doggies some
fire-toys in exchange for fighting your wights."
</p><p align=left>"You knew we had wights?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"November and I came by a while ago when that sod albino was
just setting up her attack.  Rivi had stationed a few wights out
front, and a lot more around the corner, so I knew you were going
to need help.  I bribed the closest detachment of Hounds to come
and give you a hand.  It took all the wands I had left, but they
did come through."
</p><p align=left>November gave a small snort.  "They just wanted a chance to
shoot fire at moving targets."
</p><p align=left>"Probably," Miriam admitted, "but they did what they were paid
to and mounted a frontal assault.  I knew you'd be smart enough
to run out the back.  That's why we're here."
</p><p align=left>"And now we should go," November said.  She gestured at the
red flicker of flames on the other side of the wall.  "We only
have minutes before that fire engulfs the whole quarter.
Besides, I'm sure you want to see that gate to Sigil as soon as
possible."
</p><p align=left>Despite her exhaustion, Yasmin insisted on carrying Wheezle;
and so we hurried away, following November's lead.  Miriam fell
in beside Hezekiah and the two of them began whispering to each
other, heads close and the ghost of giggles in their voices.  I
couldn't hear what they were saying, but I didn't need to: they
weren't saying anything, they were merely talking...pleased to
have the worst behind them, pleased that each step took us closer
the portal home.
</p><p align=left>Zeerith slid along beside me, a stricken expression on her
young face.  She was leaving the only world she could remember,
her adoptive family butchered by Hounds.  Some cynical part of me
didn't believe the family had been quite so kindly as Zeerith
maintained; but they were all she knew, the center of her life.
Now she was fleeing in the company of strangers, abandoning
everything familiar.
</p><p align=left>For a time, I tried to reassure her--Sigil had a small
community of nagas, a few of them Sensates whom I knew
personally.  We'd find someone to care for her until she was
ready to fend for herself.  Zeerith nodded politely and said she
was sure Sigil was a fine city...but then she lapsed into silence
again, her face wracked with grief.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Plague-Mort had no city wall, no definite edge at all.  The
raggedy shacks housing citizens outside of Rich Man's Row simply
grew farther and farther apart, and their yards increased to the
size of small fields.  Perhaps they were fields, and I was just
too much the city-dweller to tell.  It was, after all, late
autumn in Plague-Mort, with the chill of winter in the air.
Whatever crops might have filled these fields in summer were
harvested now, leaving nothing but stubble.
</p><p align=left>We kept walking, down a dark dirt road with ankle-deep ruts.
The fields came right up to the road, with only a thin strip of
weeds separating the two.  On a larger scale, the fields were
just a thin strip themselves: a few hundred feet of cleared land
on either side of the road, and beyond that, the Bush...virgin
forest, walled with shadows.  No doubt, local hunters ventured
into the woods often enough, following the game trails and daring
the underbrush; but hunters tended to camp where their ancestors
had camped, to stake out the same watering holes, to lurk outside
the same lairs.  I was sure the trees concealed wilder places, a
deep heartland where humans had not penetrated in all the
lifetime of the multiverse.
</p><p align=left>And then the fields ended.
</p><p align=left>I could see the end coming: the point where the forest closed
in around the road.  The trees were tall and rustling in the
wind, mostly elms and oaks and maples; in daylight, their leaves
might be the vibrant reds and oranges of fall, but in the
darkness they looked jet black.  Branches reached across the
road, choking off the slight glow of the overcast sky.  As we
approached, the way ahead looked like the mouth of a cave.
</p><p align=left>"Honored alu," Wheezle said in a low voice, "is this truly
wise?  The trees provide perfect cover for bandits...or perhaps
more fearsome threats."
</p><p align=left>"I'm hard to surprise," November answered.  "Besides, this
road runs spikeward and very little traffic comes this way.  You
may find the occasional barmy out here, living on nuts and
berries, but the caravan routes run east-west around the rim.
That's where you get bandits."
</p><p align=left>She said nothing about other lurking things; and the Outlands
were surely filled with dangerous beasts, especially near a
cursed town like Plague-Mort.  I looked at the blackness of the
woods, drawing nearer with each step we took, and asked, "Where
is this portal anyway?"
</p><p align=left>"Not far," November said.  "The gate is just a short way into
the forest, inside a small chapel...built long ago by a group
that worshipped the snake people."  She nodded toward Zeerith.
"The nagas claim a huge tract of land spikeward from here, but
they seldom come this close to town.  According to legend, the
nagas were embarrassed by the snake cult's form of worship, so
they left the area in distaste.  The cult faded away soon after;
some say they all committed suicide in the hope of winning back
the nagas' attention.  All I know is, the chapel has been
abandoned for as long as I've lived in Plague-Mort, and probably
centuries before that."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah cleared his throat.  "Have you, uhhh, ever been to
this chapel at night?"
</p><p align=left>I could guess what was on the boy's mind.  Abandoned chapels
do not qualify as safe places for nocturnal visits, especially if
all the former devotees killed themselves.  But November said,
"It's not haunted, if that's what you mean.  Do you know how many
do-gooders come through Plague-Mort every year?  And can you
imagine how they drool when they hear of a deserted chapel not
far from town?  If there were ever ghosts in the place, the poor
shades got cleaned out generations ago.  And don't worry about
other kinds of trouble either: a party of adventurers toured the
place just last week, and the worst they found was a squirrel who
bobbed a crust of their bread."
</p><p align=left>The others smiled at that, but not me.  My father once listed
for me a dozen lethal creatures who could magically disguise
themselves as squirrels.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The road through the forest was dark enough; but soon November
led us off on a side-path that was positively Stygian.  Only a
hint of light could struggle through the dense cover of autumn
leaves, making our trail as dark as a mineshaft.  Occasionally
something would dart across the ground, stirring up a racket
through the crisp fallen leaves; then November would call out
"Rabbit" or "Badger" to calm our startled nerves.
</p><p align=left>I had thought rabbits and badgers were field animals, not the
sort to prowl through thick woods.
</p><p align=left>We made an unconscionable amount of noise--I defy the
stealthiest of forest rangers to walk quietly along a path
covered with crinkly dry leaves--but no monsters attacked us in
the ten minutes it took to reach the chapel.  Tree roots tripped
us, nettles pricked us, and a pair of crows cawed indignantly at
having their sleep disturbed; still nothing happened.  In time,
we walked into a clearing wide enough that the trees could not
block a large patch of sky...and there in front of us was a
square stone building perhaps ten paces on each side.
</p><p align=left>"The portal is the door to the inner vestry," November said.
For some reason, she was whispering.  "The key is anything shaped
like a snake.  I've got a little talisman in my pocket, but
frankly, your friend Zeerith would probably..."
</p><p align=left>Her voice trailed off.  Speaking of things shaped like a
snake, an enormous serpent had just emerged from the door of the
chapel.  It measured more than fifteen feet, almost twice as long
as Zeerith; and although it had a male human head, it had no
hair.  Instead, it flared out a cobra's hood with menacing
intent.
</p><p align=left>"Honored naga," Wheezle shouted quickly, "we come in peace!"
</p><p align=left>"Do you?"  His voice was iced with hostility.  "When you hold
my daughter captive?"
</p><p align=left>"Daughter?" Zeerith whispered.
</p><p align=left>"She isn't a captive," Yasmin put in quickly, "she's a
refugee.  If we hadn't helped her out of town--"
</p><p align=left>"She should not have been in town!" the male naga roared.  "Do
you think we approve of leggers stealing our children?  I have
missed this daughter for years.  I have sought this daughter for
years.  And only tonight, in the moment of her molting, could I
finally sense her awakened soul.  It is a gift our kind possess,
to locate kin.  Now she has been found, and her kidnappers will
pay!"
</p><p align=left>"They didn't kidnap me," Zeerith protested weakly.  "They
saved me from a fire--"
</p><p align=left>"Silence!" the other naga commanded.  "You have known nothing
but slavery, since the day of your birth.  It has confused you.
You think of your captors as generous people who gave you food
and attention; but all leggers are exploiters, child, and they
want you to do their bidding.  If these particular leggers have
not hurt you, it only means they are more subtle than most--they
snare you with honey, rather than violence.  You are too young
and trusting.  I know better."
</p><p align=left>"You know fizz," said November in disgust.  "If this is your
daughter, take her and be piked; but save the sermons for someone
with a stronger stomach.  I'm not getting paid to put up with
such barcardle, and I certainly won't--"
</p><p align=left>A beam of red light lanced from the naga's forehead.  It
struck November in the face, splashed out, and wrapped around her
head like a veil.  She lifted her hands as if she could pull
loose the weaving scarlet; but the glow swept down her body like
a wave washing over the shore, speeding down to her toes and out
to her fingers in less than a second.  Her arms jerked to a stop.
Indeed, her whole body froze as stiff as rigor mortis, and she
tumbled to the ground like a statue knocked from its pedestal.
</p><p align=left>After a few seconds, the red light faded.  She looked no
different--still flesh and blood, not turned to stone-- but if
she was breathing at all, it was too thready to tell.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin slid her sword from its sheath.  Reluctantly, I did the
same.  "Sir," Yasmin called to the naga, "whatever you believe,
we've done nothing wrong.  The truth is, we've only known your
daughter a few hours, and in that short time, we've saved her
life from three separate threats.  Of course, you'll just dismiss
my claim as another lie.  However, I'm not lying when I tell you
this: the fate of thousands depends on us reaching Sigil before
disaster strikes.  You stand between us and the portal we need.
We don't want a fight, but we'll do what we must with a clear
conscience--you struck the first blow."
</p><p align=left>Miriam raised her fists into a fighting stance, but whispered
out of the side of her mouth to Hezekiah.  "Why don't you just
teleport us inside?"
</p><p align=left>"I can't," the boy grimaced.  "Rivi blanked me back at the
house."
</p><p align=left>"You've had a sleep since then," I reminded him, but Hezekiah
simply glowered.
</p><p align=left>"Not enough sleep," he muttered, "and not the right kind."
</p><p align=left>"We're waiting," Yasmin called to the father naga.  "Get out
of the way, and we'll leave without a fuss.  We're fond of
Zeerith and would hate to hurt you for her sake; but we will if
you leave us no choice."
</p><p align=left>"You never had a choice, leggers."  The naga's voice was
venomous...not a pleasant word to consider while confronting a
giant snake.  "When I sensed my daughter's molting," he
continued, "she was still inside the town.  I thought I'd need an
army to rescue her.  As it turns out, you've conveniently brought
her to me...but I still have the army."
</p><p align=left>Suddenly, we were surrounded by scratchy rustling sounds.
More than a dozen serpentine heads lifted from mounds of fallen
leaves scattered around the forest--a platoon of nagas emerging
from camouflage.  Yasmin sprinted for the door of the chapel, but
beams of scarlet light shot out from three directions and brought
her down like a lassoed steer.  She had time to curl into foetal
position before the rays froze her as solid as November.
</p><p align=left>Miriam cursed and threw herself on top of Hezekiah.  I dropped
to the ground and rolled in the general direction of the chapel,
aware that snakes were probably better at dirt-hugging than I
was.  Out in the darkness, Zeerith sobbed, "No, please, no..."
</p><p align=left>...then my world went scarlet, rapidly followed by black.

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
18. THREE TESTS, COME WINTER
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Magic spells have many different aftereffects.  Some leave you
feeling as if giants have diligently clubbed every bone in your
body; others cause no direct pain, but make you painfully
sensitive to loud noises; a few put you into a state of
insatiable arousal; and one I ran into in Ysgard left me unable
to see any shade of green for three days.
</p><p align=left>I paid the mage double for that one.
</p><p align=left>When I awoke from the naga's spell, my throat was ragged by a
raspy dryness, as if some frenzied clawed creature had crawled
down to my epiglottis and was now digging its way out.  There was
a marble floor beneath my cheek, and lying on it had stiffened
most of my muscles; but I was alive and relatively undamaged, a
condition I certainly hadn't expected after the nagas coldcocked
me.
</p><p align=left>Blinking, I sat up.  The space around me was huge and very
white, with marble slabs on the floor, walls, and even ceiling.
In front of me, a row of unglassed windows opened onto a grayly
overcast day, its sky displaying that muted fluffiness that
always promises snow.  Narrow marble benches ran under the
windows, situated so that you could lean back and prop your arms
comfortably on the window-ledge behind you.
</p><p align=left>A man was doing precisely that, sitting casually, watching me
gather my senses.
</p><p align=left>"Hello, Britlin," he said at last.
</p><p align=left>"Hello, Father," I answered.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Niles Cavendish had aged considerably since I'd seen him last.
His black hair was now amply salted with streaks of white; his
moustache had turned completely gray, and every line on his face
had deepened.  Laugh-lines they were called, and Father Niles had
obviously laughed a great deal after walking out on his wife and
child.
</p><p align=left>"How are you feeling?" he asked.
</p><p align=left>"Physically or emotionally?"
</p><p align=left>"Let's go with the physical for starters."
</p><p align=left>I shrugged, then silently chided myself--if I reverted to a
sulky adolescent at the first glimpse of this man, I'd soon
despise myself.  Being able to act like a grown-up was something
that set me apart from him...wasn't it?  "No broken bones," I
said.  "I'm fit to fight a pit fiend."
</p><p align=left>"With my sword."  He nodded down at my side, where the rapier
still hung from my belt.  "I'm glad it wasn't lost."
</p><p align=left>"You can have it back any time you want."
</p><p align=left>I began to unbuckle the sheath, but he waved at me to stop.
"Keep it.  I haven't handled a blade in twelve years; I'd
probably cut myself.  If it comes down to hack and slash, I'll
leave that honor to the next generation."
</p><p align=left>"Honor," I muttered under my breath.  Then more loudly, I
said, "Can you tell me what's going on here?"
</p><p align=left>"You've arrived at the Court of Light," Niles Cavendish
replied.  "The Holy of Holies for the entire naga race.  Their
Supreme Goddess Shekinester lives here somewhere, though I've
never seen her.  Not knowingly, anyway.  I've seen one sodding
lot of snakes over the years, and maybe one of them was
divine...but who knows?"
</p><p align=left>"Are we still in the Outlands?"
</p><p align=left>"Indeed," he nodded.  "Only about twelve hours from Plague-
Mort.  I gather that's where the nagas bagged you."
</p><p align=left>"You know about what happened?"
</p><p align=left>"Oh yes, they told me everything.  They intended to kill you,
but your young friend Zeerith begged so touchingly for your
lives, they decided to bring you to Shekinester and let her judge
the case."
</p><p align=left>"My companions are all right?"
</p><p align=left>"As far as I know.  Of course, Shekinester judges everyone
individually, and it's possible she's already passed sentence on
some members of your party."
</p><p align=left>"That's no problem," I told him.  "A goddess must be able to
tell we're innocent."
</p><p align=left>He smiled a rueful smile.  "Shekinester is not just a goddess,
Britlin--she's a naga goddess.  You may not have committed the
specific crime you're accused of, but that doesn't mean she'll
let you walk away intact.  She weighs your soul in its totality;
and she weighs it on her own scale.  A few years ago, Shekinester
judged two men who stumbled in here after deserting some Prime-
world army.  She killed one man for cowardice, and congratulated
the other for renouncing an immoral war.  You see?  Maybe another
deity could second-guess dear old Snake-Mother, but to mere
mortals like us, it all seems pure whim."
</p><p align=left>I stared at him curiously.  "Is it her whim for you to sit
here, smugly telling me all this?"
</p><p align=left>"It must be.  I'm still alive, aren't I?"
</p><p align=left>"So you're working for Shekinester...is that why you never
came home?"
</p><p align=left>He looked away quickly, then tried to make it into a more
casual gesture, turning to gaze out at the bleak gray sky.  "I'm
not working for the goddess; I'm here on trial, just like you."
</p><p align=left>"For the last twelve years?"
</p><p align=left>"Maybe...I lost track of time long ago.  Shekinester's tests
take as long as she wants them to take.  At present, I think
she's studying how patient I can be.  Or perhaps that's over and
she's moved on to a new phase...seeing how I'll react to your
arrival.  You may not be real at all, boy: you may just be an
illusion sent to taunt me."
</p><p align=left>I smiled grimly.  "You may be an illusion sent to taunt me."
</p><p align=left>He nodded.  "That's the way it is when you find yourself in a
deity's back yard--it becomes hard to believe in anything."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>I climbed stiffly to my feet and took stock of the situation.
The room where I stood was a long hall, stretching as far as I
could see in both directions.  It seemed to be an outer promenade
around a much larger building; how big I couldn't tell, but as
home to a goddess, it might extend for miles.
</p><p align=left>Outside the window, fat quiet snowflakes had begun to drift on
the air.  It surprised me Shekinester allowed such weather--it
couldn't be good for her cold-blooded devotees.  On the other
hand, it wasn't cold here in the hall, despite the open windows;
obviously the goddess kept her palace at a suitable temperature
and let the surrounding environment take care of itself.
</p><p align=left>"Are we supposed to stay put?" I asked my father.  "Or can we
look around?"
</p><p align=left>"Do what you like," he answered.  "When Shekinester wants to
test you, she'll start wherever you are.  I wouldn't go far
outside though."  He gestured through the window.  Now that I was
standing, I could see that the building was surrounded by winter-
dead gardens, and beyond them, dense forest.  "Bad things happen
to people out in the trees," Father said.  "You're lucky the
nagas carried you through to the hall.  If they'd left you in the
woods, you'd soon become something's dinner."
</p><p align=left>"I'll stay inside," I assured him.  "I just want to stretch my
muscles."
</p><p align=left>"Is this a way of saying you want to get away from me?"
</p><p align=left>"You can walk with me if you like."
</p><p align=left>He must have realized I was only making the offer out of
politeness; but he rose from the bench and dusted a few stray
snowflakes off his shoulder.  "After you, son," he said, waving
vaguely to let me decide which direction to go.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>We walked in silence for several minutes.  Considering how
little our surroundings changed, we might have been walking on a
treadmill that kept us in the same place.  The walls and floor
remained pristine marble, with no distinguishing features.  The
scenery outside the windows continued to be gardens and trees,
slowly accumulating a cover of white.  Nothing grew closer.
Nothing grew farther away.
</p><p align=left>Finally, my father said, "They call this place the Hall of
Tests.  Today it must be testing our boredom threshold."
</p><p align=left>"You said Shekinester was judging your patience."
</p><p align=left>"Perhaps."
</p><p align=left>He made a face and continued walking.  When I was young, I
could remember him striding with the grace and power of a tiger:
master swordsman, hero of forlorn hopes, a legend in Sigil and
many other corners of the multiverse.  Now his feet slapped
ponderously along the marble floor and I was forced to slow down
so he could keep up with me.
</p><p align=left>After a few minutes, I cleared my throat.  "You haven't asked
about Mother yet."
</p><p align=left>"No.  I haven't."
</p><p align=left>"Guilty conscience?"
</p><p align=left>"Britlin," he sighed, "I was abducted.  Something I'd done
must have caught Shekinester's attention--I still don't know
what.  One night, five nagas simply came out of nowhere, hit me
with five separate paralysis spells, and dragged me here.  I know
you must have suffered when I didn't come back, but there was
nothing I could do."
</p><p align=left>I didn't answer for several seconds.  Then I said, "Mother is
healthy enough, but she never leaves the house."
</p><p align=left>"That was true long before I left."
</p><p align=left>"If she had a husband at home to help her--"
</p><p align=left>He cut me off.  "Anne had a grown son at home.  What could I
do that you shouldn't be doing yourself?"
</p><p align=left>"I do what I can," I snapped.  "It's mostly her father's
fault, I know that, but you didn't help: filling her head with
stories about the horrors you've faced..."
</p><p align=left>Father looked at me with an unreadable expression on his face.
At last he said, "She already knew the world was full of horrors,
Britlin; what I told her was that the horrors could be defeated."
</p><p align=left>"You could have stayed with her, instead of traipsing off on
so many adventures..."
</p><p align=left>"She wanted me to go!" he growled.  Then in a quieter voice he
said, "Anne wanted me to go, Britlin.  She wanted to be a good
wife, but under the surface she feared me, just as she feared
everyone else but you.  Whenever I walked into the room, she
just...tensed like a frightened rabbit.  She worked so hard to
hide it--sometimes I heard her chanting to herself, He saved me,
he saved me, he's not like all the rest.  But she was always
relieved to have me out of the house."
</p><p align=left>"And was she relieved when you bedded other women?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Yes, Britlin, she was."  He ran his fingers sadly through his
hair.  "That part of marriage was beyond her.  But Anne couldn't
stand the thought of me living like a monk because of her.  When
I spent time with other women, it was a great relief to her; she
was glad I wasn't...deprived."
</p><p align=left>"I'm sure it comforts you to see it that way."  I refused to
give him the benefit of the doubt.
</p><p align=left>"Anne encouraged me time and time again," he answered, "and
seemed genuinely pleased when I...I'm not a lecherous man,
Britlin, but over the course of a lifetime, passion does
occasionally gain the upper hand.  When your heart is filled with
triumph or loneliness, and there's a woman in front of you,
preciously eager...can you tell me you've never been swept away?"
</p><p align=left>"No.  But I've never been married either.  And I never had a
son at home...or a daughter, as it turns out."
</p><p align=left>He looked at me curiously.  "What do you mean by that?"
</p><p align=left>"Did you ever tell a woman your name was Rudy Liagar?  A
tiefling woman?"
</p><p align=left>He said nothing.  I could see the answer was yes.
</p><p align=left>"She bore you a child," I told him.  "A daughter named
Yasmin...who may be under judgment by Shekinester even as we
speak.  The nagas took her the same time they took me."
</p><p align=left>He closed his eyes and lowered his head.  "Now I know you're
simply an illusion, sent to taunt me.  A daughter?  I have a
child...a daughter?"
</p><p align=left>"So I believe."
</p><p align=left>"And what is she like?" he demanded.  "Is she...never mind!"
</p><p align=left>Without waiting for me to speak, he ran to the nearest window
and vaulted over the sill.  He struck the ground heavily,
crumpling to his knees in the thin layer of snow; but he quickly
regained his feet and staggered out across the garden.  His
breath steamed away from him, and the snow clogged around the
edges of his boots.  He ran stiffly, as if he hadn't moved at
speed for a long time.
</p><p align=left>As if he had grown old.
</p><p align=left>I realized, of course, that he must have an idea where Yasmin
was being held...that he was going to her, or going to appeal to
someone on her behalf.  It didn't matter--I couldn't bring myself
to follow him, although I could easily catch up with his clumsy
old running.  Some part of me felt pleased I'd finally pierced
him; another part felt burning shame.
</p><p align=left>In about a minute, he disappeared behind a cedar hedge.  Then
he was gone.
</p><p align=left>His footprints began to fill with unhurried snow.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>After a while, I started walking again--if I had stayed in one
place, watching the snow fall so somberly, I might have crumbled
into tears.  There is always something sad about the first
snowfall; I told myself that was all I was feeling.
</p><p align=left>With every step along the marble floor, I replayed the
conversation with my father...our first talk since he'd
disappeared twelve years ago, or maybe the first talk in our
lives.  A hundred things I should have said rose unbidden in my
mind: resentments that refused to solidify into rational phrases.
I knew I was right--he'd been a bad father to me, a worse husband
to my mother--but every time I put my reasons into words, they
sounded childish and petty.  That must be his fault too; his oh-
so-noble attitude reduced me to a whining adolescent.
</p><p align=left>And still the snow fell.  Still the hall continued unchanging
in front of me: white floor, white wall, white ceiling.
Suddenly, my anger at my father veered off into fury at the bland
surroundings, and I cried, "Enough is enough!  Where's the door
out?"
</p><p align=left>The only answer was silence, all echoes of my voice soaked up
by the snow outside.
</p><p align=left>Should I take the easy exit: hop through an open window into
the garden?  If this boring sameness was a test from Shekinester,
leaving by the obvious route wasn't a clever answer.  Perhaps
there was a hidden way out, some concealed door I was supposed to
find...or perhaps this featureless hall was simply an illusion I
could break with sufficient willpower.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said to the air.  "You do understand, you're
dealing with a Sensate?"
</p><p align=left>Shekinester must know my faction; I wasn't sure how deeply a
god could see into my soul, but it didn't take omniscience to
notice the signet ring on my finger.  Had she designed this test
to see how true I was to the Sensate ideal?  Or had she set
things up specifically to deceive the Sensate mind?
</p><p align=left>I'd soon find out.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Step one: marking the territory.  I jumped into the garden,
and cleared away enough snow to dig up two handfuls of loose
earth.  Clambering back inside was accompanied by a certain
amount of soil spillage, leaving dirty smears down the front of
my pants; but I managed the trick at last and deposited one
hand's worth of loam on the immaculate marble floor.
</p><p align=left>"Starting point," I said to no one in particular.
</p><p align=left>Keeping my eye on the dirt, I paced up the hall--about a
hundred and fifty yards, until the brown clot of soil was getting
hard to see against the white background.  Looking the other
direction along the hall, I didn't see any such clump.  That was
comforting: you never knew when a tricky magical effect might
turn a seemingly straight corridor into an endless loop.  The
possibility still existed, of course, if the length of the loop
was longer than three hundred yards; but I had a hunch that I
wouldn't have to stray so far afield to find a way out.  Stooping
again, I placed my other handful of dirt to mark out the end of
the region I'd search.
</p><p align=left>For the next hour or so, I scanned the walls, floor and
ceiling between my two markers: looking for tiny irregularities,
tapping each tile, pressing and probing to see if any marble
square had even the ghost of a wobble.  No such ghosts
materialized--whether Shekinester built this palace herself or
allowed her worshippers to build it for her, someone had achieved
a flawless feat of construction.
</p><p align=left>When my search reached the original marker, I turned around
and started up the hall again, this time examining the window
sills and the benches beneath them.  The benches, made from solid
slabs of marble, were too heavy to move without risking a hernia;
I decided I wouldn't try to budge one unless I had good reason.
That meant minute investigation of each bench and the floor where
it stood, hoping to detect evidence of jiggery-pokery...but
again, I found nothing but the most solid construction, not the
tiniest scratch or blemish.  By the time I reached the other
marker, I knew I had to take a different approach.
</p><p align=left>Think--Shekinester, queen of the nagas.  What did I know about
nagas?  Snake-people: no arms, no legs.  They could all cast
magic spells...but I couldn't, so if the way out required
sorcery, I had no chance of success.  Gods have never been noted
for playing fair with mortals, but I didn't think Shekinester
would set me a test that was completely impossible.  It wouldn't
have enough entertainment value.
</p><p align=left>Nagas...snakes...slithering along the ground, flicking their
forked tongues...
</p><p align=left>Hmmm.
</p><p align=left>I lay down on my stomach and stuck out my own tongue.  As I
told Zeerith, I knew a few Sensate nagas in Sigil, and they were
forever bragging about the acuteness of their taste buds.  They
could taste things on the air the way a bloodhound smells
odors...and the forks of their tongues even let them track
directions--if a taste was stronger on the left fork than the
right, they knew where to turn to hunt out the source.
</p><p align=left>Could I taste anything now?  Just a hint of bitterness.  I
sniffed about, and soon realized I was sensing the heap of dirt
I'd placed as a marker in front of me.  Crawling away from the
soil, I felt rather pleased that I could detect anything at all.
In a few yards, the taste/smell of the dirt faded and I got down
to the serious business of examining the world, serpent-style.
</p><p align=left>Slither on my stomach.  Stick out my tongue.  Sniff for any
odors beyond my own sweat.  I must have looked ridiculous, but I
regarded that as a positive thing--if Shekinester disdained
"leggers" like the naga we'd met at the chapel, she'd be
delighted by my clumsy performance.  It would confirm her sense
of superiority.
</p><p align=left>Mind you, she was a goddess.  She was superior.
</p><p align=left>For the first few yards, I kept my tongue out continuously,
thinking that the more exposure, the more chance I had of tasting
something worthy of note.  After a minute, however, the air left
my tongue as dry as an autumn leaf, its surface as numb as
leather.  Changing tactics, I began to flick out my tongue for a
few seconds, then pull it back into my mouth where I could
contemplate any flavors that might have been procured...like a
wine taster, swishing around the latest vintage in search of
fruity aftertones.
</p><p align=left>Surprisingly, I found something.
</p><p align=left>Was it a testament to my refined Sensate perceptions?  Or did
Shekinester amplify the taste to give my dim "legger" senses a
fighting chance?  It didn't matter.  After a mere five minutes of
dragging around on my belly, I caught a distinct flavor of
oranges wafting on the air.  Sniff, sniff...there was no smell,
just the taste.  That had to be a good sign: it smacked of magic.
</p><p align=left>I wriggled forward a few more feet, and tried the air again.
The orange flavor had weakened.  Were my taste buds becoming
jaded?  Oh, for a quick sorbet to refresh the palate!  But I
backtracked and found the flavor as strong as ever in my original
position.  All right: I was on to something.
</p><p align=left>Lick, lick the air.  Toward the windows...the flavor dwindled.
The opposite direction...and the taste grew more acute, tartly
acidic as if the oranges were still completely green.  By the
time I reached the wall, the sensation was as sharp as spikes on
my tongue, like lapping the spill from a tannery: the purified
essence of oranges, biting and nasty.  It burned my mouth,
bringing tears to my eyes and making my nose run freely.
</p><p align=left>If it had somehow started a ringing in my ears, the moment
would have been perfect.
</p><p align=left>My tongue touched the wall, and suddenly the taste vanished.
For a few worried moments, I wondered if my tongue had totally
shut down under the bitter assault; but I lifted my fingers to my
mouth and could taste the gamey salt of my perspiration.  I tried
the wall again--absolutely nothing.
</p><p align=left>Hmm.
</p><p align=left>As an experiment, I dropped my mouth to the marble floor.  It
was warm, probably the source of the heat that kept this hall
more livable than the snowy garden.  The tile tasted of dust, and
the slightly mineral tang of marble.
</p><p align=left>The wall looked exactly like the floor--pure white stone the
two of them.  Yet the wall had no taste at all.
</p><p align=left>I moved down a few panels and tasted the wall again.  This set
of tiles were much like the floor, warm against my tongue and
tinged with dust.  But on the first patch of wall, the tiles
still radiated an intense flavor of oranges but had no taste at
all when my mouth actually touched them.
</p><p align=left>It had the unmistakable air of magic at work.  That part of
the wall had to be an illusion--good enough to fool sight and
touch, but not meant to deceive all five senses.  A snake sliding
down the hall would be led straight to this spot by the spoor of
oranges, and would know with its tongue that the tiles were
false.
</p><p align=left>Dropping down to my stomach again, I closed my eyes and stuck
out my tongue.  Inch by inch I crawled forward, waiting for the
moment when my tongue would actually press against the wall and
stop.
</p><p align=left>The moment never came.  The illusion yielded, as intangible as
mist...and when I opened my eyes, I was no longer in the
featureless marble hall.  Nor was I alone.  A centaur, tall and
muscular, towered above me.
</p><p align=left>"Ah," he said.  "I see that you're painting."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"I'm not..."
</p><p align=left>For a moment, my head spun dizzily, blackness crowding around
me.  Then the world snapped back into focus: a noisy world, full
of people talking to each other or simply waiting in lines.  I
was standing beside my easel, a brush in my hand...and all around
me was the complacent ruckus of the Sigil City Courts.
</p><p align=left>"The hustle and bustle of what this city calls justice," the
centaur continued.  "Prisoners hobbling by in chains.  Litigants
glaring at each other as they await trial..."
</p><p align=left>His voice droned on, but I ignored it.  This whole scene was
unquestionably an illusion.  Even if Shekinester could magically
transport me to Sigil, the City Courts would not look so
pleasantly normal.  By now, the Guvners might have scraped up the
charred corpses; but it would take months to clean away the
scorch marks, and even longer to purge the ashen smell of cooked
pork.
</p><p align=left>"What is your theme, young man?" the centaur demanded.
</p><p align=left>"My theme?" I asked, coming out of my daze.
</p><p align=left>"What artistic statement are you making?  How the law
oppresses--"
</p><p align=left>I grabbed him by his husky shoulders.  "Stop rattling your
bone-box!  You're a sodding illusion, that's all you are.  This
is all a sodding illusion!"
</p><p align=left>"Ah...now that is an interesting theme," he answered with a
judicious nod.  "Far from original, of course, but still a meaty
proposition.  Is our existence simply a fantasy in the mind of
some unknown dreamer?  Are we all figments of some higher
imagination?  I applaud you, young man.  That is precisely the
sort of issue Great Art should address..."
</p><p align=left>I closed my ears to his prattle.  It was not the time to think
about Great Art; it was a time to gape at Bleach-Hair Petrov as
he and two cronies walked into the rotunda.  The trio were once
more disguised as Harmonium guards...and dangling at their sides
hung three ruby-glittered firewands.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>It hadn't happened this way: the fireballers hadn't arrived
till later, maybe half an hour after I'd brushed off the centaur.
Hezekiah had been with me then--Hezekiah who had teleported me
away from blazing death.  It was too early, the Clueless boy was
nowhere in sight...and Petrov was moving toward the center of the
rotunda.
</p><p align=left>What to do?  The sword at my side had vanished--I hadn't been
wearing it that day at the courts--and a bare-handed attack on
the false guards would buy me nothing.  All three were broad-
shouldered brawlers, more than able to hold their own in a fist-
fight with me; even given the element of surprise, I'd be lucky
to deck a single one of them before the other two roasted me in
my boots.  There were a pair of genuine Harmonium guards flanking
the front entrance, but they would be no use.  Even if I had time
to run across and persuade them to help, we could scarcely
approach the fireballers without being noticed.  As soon as they
saw us coming, Petrov and his henchmen would start blasting.
</p><p align=left>Of course, I did have time to run--to dash down the closest
corridor and lose myself in the warren of Guvner offices before
the carnage started.  I even considered standing my ground, doing
nothing: this was an illusion, wasn't it, sent by Shekinester to
test me.  With an iron will, I could ignore the flames from the
firewands...but could I ignore the screams of the people as they
burned?  The high whistling shrieks of throats too ruined to make
any other sound...
</p><p align=left>No.  There are some sounds willpower can't shut out.  And
there are times when a man has to fight with the only weapons he
has.
</p><p align=left>I snatched up a stick of charcoal from my box of art supplies.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>

</p><p align=left>The top of my canvas was filled with curlicues, but the lower
two thirds was still blank.  That was where I would draw my
picture.  Closing my eyes for a moment, I thought of the image I
wanted to draw, re-creating every detail in my mind.  There
wouldn't be time for details, for flawless accuracy or
technique--just a thirty second sketch that conveyed a message so
powerful it would freeze the hand of a killer.
</p><p align=left>Taking a deep breath, I began to draw.
</p><p align=left>The outlines of a man's body.  A short scepter in his hand.  A
face, Petrov's face: I had no time to spend on every feature, but
I could show a man weeping in agony.
</p><p align=left>Flames ravaging Petrov's flesh as Unveiler burned.
</p><p align=left>Rivi, simpering at Petrov's pain.
</p><p align=left>It was all suggestion, all sweeping lines and rough
edges...yet I knew what I was drawing, could see it clearly in my
mind's eye.  Petrov in the machine room of the Glass Spider,
forced to do Rivi's will--forced by her to hold Unveiler while
ungodly heat shriveled his arm.
</p><p align=left>I had no time for niceties.  The finished picture was scarcely
a picture at all, just allusions of horror and suffering; to
other eyes it might be jumbled nonsense, but to me it was as
clear as the most fastidious rendering.
</p><p align=left>I had captured the essence, not the image.  Pray that Petrov
saw what I did.
</p><p align=left>Ripping the canvas off the easel, I held it high above my
head.  The false guards had gone into their huddle in the middle
of the room, concealing their actions as they drew their
firewands.  I walked toward them, arms high; and people, looking
at the swirling sketch over my head, shuffled back out of my way.
Each viewer's eyes opened wide.  Mouths dropped open, and a few
hurried around in front to get a second look.  The centaur, now
standing across the room, squinted at the canvas, then softly
began to applaud.
</p><p align=left>Throughout the rotunda, the noise of the crowd changed.  Many
fell silent, just staring.  Those out of position to see the
sketch whispered to one another, asking what it might be.  The
Harmonium guards at the front entrance stepped inside, hands
reaching for their swords; no doubt they had heard the hush and
thought it meant trouble.
</p><p align=left>Petrov and his henchmen sensed the growing silence too.  They
broke their huddle, firewands snapping out to the ready.  Over by
the entrance, the real guards sucked in their breaths--they
recognized the lethal potential of the situation.  If they
charged their way forward, hundreds of innocent people might
die...and no matter how bull-headed the Harmonium can be, these
two had their priorities straight.  They froze, blades drawn,
anger glittering in their eyes; for the moment, they would
restrain themselves, rather than precipitate a bloodbath.
</p><p align=left>"Don't anyone move," one of the real guards commanded.  "Let's
all be peery as angels."
</p><p align=left>The closest henchman curled his lip and raised his wand; but I
shouted, "Petrov!" and Bleach-Hair turned to face me.
</p><p align=left>His gaze swept across my face without recognition.  Then he
looked higher, to the canvas over my head, and his eyes narrowed.
"What's that then?" he snapped.
</p><p align=left>"Look at it," I replied.  "It's your future.  If you use those
wands, if you keep working for Rivi, your future ends like this."
</p><p align=left>He sneered, but his eyes remained on the picture.  I continued
forward to give him a better view.  No one else moved in the
whole rotunda; no one whispered, no one shuffled feet or tried to
draw a weapon.
</p><p align=left>"You can see it's real," I told Petrov.  "This isn't just a
figment of my imagination, this is something I saw.  Look at it.
You know what you're seeing."
</p><p align=left>His expression scarcely changed--a small tightening of the
lips, a tiny narrowing of the eyes--but I knew the very instant
when the image blazed its way into his mind.  He saw himself
burning, he saw Rivi laughing...and he saw it was the truth.
</p><p align=left>Petrov let out his breath slowly.  "Come on, bloods," he said
without looking at his henchmen, "let's hop it."
</p><p align=left>"But we haven't--"
</p><p align=left>"I said, hop it."
</p><p align=left>With deliberate slowness, he reached into his shirt and pulled
out a golden amulet hanging around his neck.  His gaze never left
my sketch.  He lifted the amulet to his lips and paused a moment:
for the briefest of seconds, he lowered his eyes and nodded
toward me.  Then he kissed the amulet's golden face, and the
three fireballers vanished in a shimmer of silver.
</p><p align=left>Inch by inch, the shimmer spread: enveloping the closest
bystanders, still frozen in shock; sweeping across the two
Harmonium guards, one gritting his teeth that the criminals had
escaped, the other simply looking relieved.  On and on the silver
glimmer grew, dissolving the tapestries that covered every wall
space, the cornugon, the deva...until the entire rotunda had
vanished, the people, the stones, the curlicues.  I was wrapped
in a soft vibrancy of light, warm and approving.
</p><p align=left>Then, stepping through the shimmer came my father and Yasmin,
walking arm-in-arm.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"So you found her," I said to my father.
</p><p align=left>"She was looking for me," he replied.
</p><p align=left>"One of the Shekinester's little tests," Yasmin muttered.  I
waited for her to say more, but the clench of her jaw showed she
had no intention of explaining.
</p><p align=left>My father had also noted the grimness of her expression.
Patting her on the shoulder, he said, "That's all behind you now,
girl.  And I can tell you something to cheer you up."
</p><p align=left>She slipped away from his arm.  "What is it?"
</p><p align=left>"Britlin," he turned to me, "Yasmin says you two...that you've
been..."
</p><p align=left>"Incest," I said.  "Is that the word you're looking for?"
</p><p align=left>"That word must be on your minds," he nodded, "but you can
forget it."
</p><p align=left>"I can't forget it," Yasmin told him, a harsh edge to her
voice.  "I can't...not if Britlin's my brother."
</p><p align=left>"But he isn't your brother."
</p><p align=left>Her eyes narrowed.  "You aren't my father, after all?"
</p><p align=left>"I may be your father, Yasmin, but I know I'm not his."
</p><p align=left>He turned his finger to point to me.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"What are you talking about?" I demanded.  "I know you're my
father."
</p><p align=left>"No, Britlin, I'm not."
</p><p align=left>"You're lying," I snapped.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin," he said softly, "you know how your mother is.  Do
you really think she'd let me touch her?  Ever?  I didn't father
you, boy.  Of all the women who took me to their beds, your
mother wasn't one of them."
</p><p align=left>"Then who was my father?"
</p><p align=left>"Duke Urbin, of course--Anne's own father.  She was pregnant
by him when I found her.  That was really the only reason he let
me take her away: he wanted her out of Aquilune before his
neighbors noticed her condition.  They'd all know who had
fathered the child, and there are some crimes even a duke can't
get away with.  He performed the wedding ceremony himself, then
sent Anne and me back to Sigil where she'd be safely out of
sight."
</p><p align=left>My heart had seized in my chest.  "And I was the..."
</p><p align=left>"You were the child, yes.  Not the fruit of my loins, but I
tried to be a father to you.  At first, just for Anne's sake, but
then for your own.  I liked having a son, Britlin.  Just as I
like having a daughter."  He smiled at Yasmin.  "But you two have
no common blood.  Nothing stands between you."
</p><p align=left>I wanted to sit down; but there were no chairs, just the
surrounding silver shimmer, as if we stood completely separate
from the rest of the multiverse.  With all the resentments I had
felt toward my father...but he was not my father, he was just a
professional hero, who had saved my mother as he would save
anyone else in trouble.  He married her because that was the way
to save her, and he had supported me throughout childhood because
that was the honorable thing to do.  Could I resent him anymore?
In a single revelation, he had released me from the burden of
living up to him...not to mention freeing me to love Yasmin.
</p><p align=left>By all the gods, it was slickly done.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin stepped forward, her face beaming.  She was reaching
out to wrap her arms around my neck when I said, "No."
</p><p align=left>"'No' what?" she asked.
</p><p align=left>"No to everything."  I pulled away from her.  "This is all too
piking convenient."
</p><p align=left>"What are you talking about?"  Her smile collapsed.  "Why are
you acting like a berk?"
</p><p align=left>"My father," I said, gesturing toward him.  "After twelve
years, he just shows up here in the Court of Light.  He has a
plausible explanation for everything--why he never came back, how
my mother would be happy that he consorted with other women--and
he even tells us it's perfectly all right to be lovers if we
want.  Isn't that neat?  Isn't that glib?  One little secret
clears away all the shadows.
</p><p align=left>"Well, I refuse to believe it," I continued.  "I would refuse
to believe it if I heard it in Sigil, and I certainly refuse to
believe it when it's delivered here in the Hall of Tests.  Niles
Cavendish is my father.  I know that so deeply in my heart, all
the waters of the River Styx couldn't wash the knowledge away.
I've longed to be someone else's son, but I'm not--I don't have
that choice.  Neither does Shekinester."
</p><p align=left>I waved my hands to dismiss the people in front of me.  "Go
back to the goddess now.  Tell her I'm my father's son.  I won't
say I've made my peace with that, but it's time to stop denying
the truth."
</p><p align=left>Both the others opened their mouths as if they intended to
argue; but no words came out.  The expression on my face must
have told them debate was futile.  For a moment, the two
exchanged glances...and then my father simply dissolved into
copper-colored sparks that fell to the ground like rain.
</p><p align=left>"An illusion, of course," I murmured.  Turning to Yasmin, I
said, "He was never here at all, was he?"
</p><p align=left>"He visited our court long ago," came the answer.  "He is
elsewhere now."
</p><p align=left>The voice was not Yasmin's--it was still female but deeper,
impossibly golden.  No human throat had ever spoken with such
soft power.  In the blink of an eye, Yasmin's body flared to a
brilliant white, so dazzling I had to avert my eyes.  The image
thinned and lengthened, twisting and turning in spirals around
me, until I was ringed by a snake of white fire, its tail
stretching around and around in ever-widening circles.  A fierce
heat beat against my face; but I managed to stammer out,
"Shekinester?"
</p><p align=left>"Only one of Her daughters," the flaming serpent replied.
"You have passed our Mother's tests.  Be glad."
</p><p align=left>"What about my friends?"
</p><p align=left>"They are being tested too.  If they are weak, they shall
fail."
</p><p align=left>"I'd like to help them," I said.
</p><p align=left>"You cannot.  In this place, all souls stand alone."
</p><p align=left>The naga's blazing face sizzled close to mine, too blindingly
bright for me to make out any features.  With the speed of a
cobra striking, her head darted forward, directly at me; but
instead of a bite, I felt the kiss of fiery lips on my cheek.
Light flared from all directions...and abruptly, I was standing
near the center of a large stone chamber, high-ceilinged and
devoid of decoration.
</p><p align=left>There was only one source of illumination in all that great
wide space--a pillar of snow-white flame, burning in the very
heart of the room.  I stood at the base of a flight of low stone
steps, leading up to the fire like the ascent to a tabernacle.
</p><p align=left>Surrounding me, filling the chamber to the very walls, stood
an army of the undead.  Simple zombies, their skins hanging in
loose and rotting sags...skeletons with bony faces in perpetual
grins...a cloudy congregation of ghosts, specters, haunts, and
wraiths, as thick as midnight fog...vampires, pallid and
mesmerizing, standing shoulder to shoulder with lich sorcerers,
their fleshless fingers a'glitter with heavy-jeweled rings...and
of course, scattered throughout the dark company, the baleful
bonfire eyes of wights.
</p><p align=left>From reflex, my hand dropped to my side.  It touched my
father's rapier, restored to me now that the testing was over;
but I let my fingers relax, and did not draw.
</p><p align=left>"Okay," I called to the assembled horde.  "Hands up all those
who feel as uncomfortable as I do right now."
</p><p align=left>I thought I saw a zombie lift its arm, but it might just have
been rigor mortis.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>With a rattle of bones and armor, a death knight stepped from
the front row of watchers.  It wore chain mail, covered with a
tabard that had once been pure white linen; but a fuzzy black
smut had grown over the cloth, powdering out whatever emblem this
knight had fought for in life.  The creature's face was skeletal,
with the orbit around one eye raggedly smashed away--probably a
death blow from a mace, sending this once-noble warrior to an
uneasy afterlife.
</p><p align=left>When the knight spoke, its voice had the chilling tone of a
crumbling mortuary.  "Now," it said, "you must enter the Arching
Flame."
</p><p align=left>"The Arching Flame?"  I looked back over my shoulder at the
pillar of fire.  "That flame?"
</p><p align=left>"You have passed the easy tests," the creature said.  "Now you
must be purified."
</p><p align=left>"If that involves incineration, I'd rather not."
</p><p align=left>"The flame does not burn those who are true to themselves.  It
cleanses.  It restores."  The knight turned its head toward the
brightness.  "I would enter it myself if I could."
</p><p align=left>With a wave of my hand, I said, "Be my guest.  I'll sign over
my ticket."
</p><p align=left>The knight's sword whipped out of its scabbard so fast the
blade was a blur.  Its tip pointed directly at my throat.  "Take
care," the knight whispered.  "Take care your flippant tongue
does not start you down the road I have traveled.  It is
Shekinester's will that you enter the flame.  If you defy the
goddess...but I shall not let you do that.  Damned though I am, I
will not permit you to suffer such a curse."
</p><p align=left>The creature stepped forward and I had to retreat, backing
away hurriedly from that sword.  The weapon's blade was fuzzed
thickly with the same black smut that covered the knight's
tabard--fungal rot from a corruption that should have returned to
the soil long ago.  I leapt toward a gap in the front row of
monsters...but suddenly, a phantom flickered into existence to
fill the space, milky and groaning.
</p><p align=left>"No escape, mortal," the death knight said behind me.
"Shekinester wishes you to enter the flame.  Whatever we might
have been in life, we are hers now.  She has given us relief from
the raging insanity that affects others of our kind.  In thanks,
we do her bidding within this chamber."
</p><p align=left>I looked out at the decaying company.  Their faces did not
twist with rage or regret, the two great anguishes of most
undead; I saw only resolve, a determination to fulfill their duty
to Shekinester and her flame.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I shrugged.  "Into the fire I go."
</p><p align=left>Tossing a rakish wave to the knight, I ran up the steps and
did a half-gainer into the heart of the blaze.
</p>

19. THREE FOPS IN THE FOREST
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>If I could remember what happened within the Arching Flame,
I'd try to describe it.  Heaven knows, I could peel free drinks
for the rest of my life, just telling the tale to Sensates who
wanted to know what it felt like to stand within that withering
blaze.  All that remains in my mind, however, is a brief moment
of light, sensed not just with my eyes but with my skin, as if
every inch of my flesh could see the brilliance that pierced me
to the bone.  My clothes vaporized in an instant, every fiber
bursting into dusty smoke...
</p><p align=left>...and then I lay naked under a night sky, the chill of snow
beneath me.  Clouds drifted across the darkness, but only a few:
high wisps and tatters slipping along the starless black.
</p><p align=left>I sighed; and my breath turned to steam, drifting straight up
on the calm air.  For one brief moment, I was content to watch it
mist away to nothingness...then the cold against my backside
finally bit into my consciousness, and I dragged myself to my
feet.
</p><p align=left>Before me stood the chapel to the nagas, the small stone
building just outside of Plague-Mort.  Snowflakes now dusted its
roof, and nestled in the cracks of its crumbling masonry; but
nothing else had changed.  The surrounding forest had lost some
of its dense foliage, the trees too disheartened to keep hold of
their leaves now that the snow had come; and the rustle of small
creatures scurrying through the darkness had grown quiet in the
time we had been gone.  Winter had descended, true winter...a
time of peace and resignation, no matter how the cold shivered
against my skin.
</p><p align=left>"Oh good," said a pleasant female voice.  "You're awake."
</p><p align=left>A few yards away, Zeerith had coiled herself into the bole of
an ancient elm, her tail draping down the tree's rough bark.  It
disconcerted me to stand unclothed in front of her cherubic teen-
aged face; but she showed no sign of embarrassment herself.  I
suppose she must have looked upon me with the same indifference a
human feels to see a dog naked.  Then again..."Aren't you cold
down there?" she asked from her perch.  "I came up here to get
away from the snow."
</p><p align=left>"It would be nice to have some clothes," I told her.
"Something warm."
</p><p align=left>Her brow furrowed for a moment, and she closed her eyes.  The
air filled with a barely audible buzzing, both a sound and a
tangible prickling against my skin.  I looked down and saw motes
of white dust drifting out of the night, floating up to my body
and settling down with the softness of feathers.  More and more
of the tiny specks swept from the darkness, until they began to
clump together in downy swatches that quickly warmed with my body
heat.  Still the dust streamed in; it thickened into a matted
layer as cozy as brushed felt, but lighter than the finest linen.
Almost as an afterthought, the covering of dust partitioned
itself into separate garments, pants, shirt, jacket, gloves, and
all of an utterly pure white.
</p><p align=left>"Feet," Zeerith said, still concentrating intensely.  I lifted
one foot, then the other, to give the inflooding stream a chance
to coat me with dense white boots, lighter than my old ones but
as tough as metal plate.  When those were done, I thought the
outfit was finished; but the flow of dust simply shifted to my
head, fashioning itself into a warm cowl that covered my hair and
the back of my neck.  I had the suspicion that Zeerith had shaped
it to resemble a cobra's hood: a young naga's attempt to make a
"legger" look less like a pathetic monkey.
</p><p align=left>"Well," I said when the dust had stopped pouring in, "you seem
to have mastered the knack of magic fast enough."
</p><p align=left>"My father's been helping me," she answered.  "He's, um,
insistent I learn my lessons quickly."
</p><p align=left>"He looked like the kind to be strict," I agreed.  "Where is
he now?"
</p><p align=left>"Prowling the woods.  He's impatient to get back to his own
territory, but I wouldn't leave till I knew you were all right."
</p><p align=left>"I appreciate that," I assured her.  "And what about my
friends?"
</p><p align=left>"Mother Shekinester will test them in Her own time," Zeerith
said.  "If they survive the flame, my uncles and aunts will carry
them back here.  My relatives may not like leggers, but if your
friends pass the Mother's tests, my family will be honor-bound to
provide that much help."
</p><p align=left>"What happens," I asked reluctantly, "if my friends don't pass
Shekinester's tests?"
</p><p align=left>"They still enter the flame," Zeerith replied.  "They just
don't come out.  The fire...it burns the soul as well as the
body; there's nothing left."
</p><p align=left>"Does that happen often?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't know.  I've asked my father a great many questions,
but some he refuses to--"
</p><p align=left>"Zeerith!" shouted a voice from the forest.  "It's time to
go."
</p><p align=left>"But, Father..."
</p><p align=left>"You wished to ensure the legger's safety.  You have done so.
I see no reason to waste further time in such a creature's
presence."
</p><p align=left>Zeerith gave me an apologetic look, but I simply smiled.
"Fathers take some getting used to," I said.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>After they had gone, I took stock of myself.  If the Arching
Flame had "purified" me, I could detect no obvious difference.
True, I felt superbly limber, free from the twinges and stiffness
one gets from sleeping on the floor of an umbral hut; but why
jump into a pillar of fire, when I could get the same relief from
eight hours in a decent bed?  At the moment I didn't feel hungry
or thirsty either, although days might have passed since I last
put something in my stomach...still, you'd expect that visiting a
goddess might have more profound effects than a good meal.
Perhaps the blaze had burned away intangible imperfections--the
"plugs of butter congealing in my heart", as one dour Athar
doctor warned me--but I had no way of perceiving such hidden
cleansings.  Suffice it to say, I felt good but not
supernaturally blessed...which left me wondering what I should do
next.
</p><p align=left>November had told us the chapel held a portal to Sigil, and
its key was the image of a serpent.  I could make such a picture
easily enough--rip off bark from the nearest tree and use a sharp
stone to scratch out a drawing--but did I want to run back to
Sigil before my companions returned?  The thought of leaving
without them turned my stomach: Niles Cavendish's son did not
abandon his friends.  On the other hand, did I dare waste
precious time waiting for them when Rivi might be running rampant
in the streets of my home?
</p><p align=left>And how much time had I lost already?  The nagas had kidnapped
us at night, it had been daytime at the Court of Light, and now
it was night again.  That meant at least twenty-four hours...but
it could have been much more, depending on how long the nagas had
kept us paralyzed and how long I'd been unconscious after going
through the flame.
</p><p align=left>As I debated the question, my gaze roamed around the dark
clearing and lit on something that reflected the white of my
clothes like a mirror.  When I investigated, I found my father's
sword thrust into the frozen earth, almost a foot of its tip dug
into the soil.  The nagas must have brought it with them as they
carried me to this place; but I found it hard to imagine either
of them gripping the hilt by mouth and plunging it into the
ground so forcefully.  Perhaps Shekinester herself had
transported the rapier here: a hint from the goddess that it was
time for me to do battle.
</p><p align=left>Wrapping my fingers around the sword's pommel, I pulled up
tentatively, just to test how firmly the blade was implanted in
the soil.  It slid out of the ground as soft as a whisper, as if
the weapon was pushing itself free and I was simply holding on.
When I looked at the tip, there wasn't the slightest fleck of
dirt on the metal, nor any of the nicks and notches you'd expect
from ramming a honed length of steel into the frozen forest
floor.  Indeed, the sword gleamed sharper than I'd ever seen
before; and it occurred to me that I'd been wearing the rapier
when I jumped into the flame.  Just as the fire had scorched away
my little aches and pains, it must have refined any minute
imperfections in the weapon, leaving it sharper, more lethal,
more magical than ever.
</p><p align=left>I laughed softly, then lifted my head to the sky.  "You think
you had a great sword, Father...you should see mine."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Five minutes later, I was putting the last touches onto a
sketch scratched into a punky piece of oak bark.  To make the
image of a snake, I might have got away with a mere squiggly
line--portals are seldom picky--but I had my pride.  The picture
showed a cobra ready to strike, its body raised, its hood flared,
its fangs dripping venom...which is easier said than done, when
your only drawing implement is a 4B wedge of limestone.
</p><p align=left>In the dim light I stared at the sketch, trying to decide if
it needed something else or if adding more would clutter things
up--the perennial dilemma of every artist-- when I heard a
rustling in the woods.  Immediately I sprinted for the chapel,
where I could hide in the blackness of the doorway...and where,
if worst came to worst, I could use my drawing to flee through
the portal to Sigil.
</p><p align=left>Silent moments passed, and I began to wonder if I'd been
spooked by some porcupine, late for hibernation.  Then, as hushed
as an owl in flight, two nagas entered the clearing.  The one in
front, a huge female with fangs so white they glowed, carried her
head warily; her tongue flicked in and out constantly, left,
right, left, as if she were certain that trouble must be lurking
close by.  Behind her, the other naga was smaller, with the
fresh-hatched face of a boy scarcely older than Zeerith.  He
showed none of the caution of the other--in fact, he sported a
beaming grin, suggesting he was enjoying every second of this
adventure away from home.
</p><p align=left>Clinging to his neck, like a child riding a pony, sat Wheezle.
The gnome wore on over-long robe cut in Dustman style; but
instead of a somber gray, this garment was as white as the face
of a moon.  Even in this starless night, the cloth shone and
shimmered as if it had been peeled off an unusually generous
ghost.
</p><p align=left>The front naga hissed sharply, and stared in my direction.
Belatedly, I remembered that I too was dressed in purest
white--not the best sartorial choice for someone hiding in
shadows.  "It's all right," I called quickly.  Stepping from the
darkness, I said, "I'm a friend."
</p><p align=left>"Honored Cavendish!" cried Wheezle with delight.  He hopped
from his perch on the young naga and ran forward, his arms wide.
I was so astonished to see him on his feet again, I didn't react;
so when he reached me, he wrapped his arms around my knees and
squeezed in warm embrace.
</p><p align=left>"You can walk again!" I marveled.
</p><p align=left>"He has passed through the flame," the older naga said.  "Why
should you doubt that it healed him?  Do you think the sacred
fire is weak?"
</p><p align=left>"No, no," I answered quickly.  "I've been through the flame
myself, you know."
</p><p align=left>The naga blinked once, then she grudgingly nodded her head.
"You are to be congratulated for passing Our Mother's test."
</p><p align=left>"And you passed too, Wheezle."  I squatted and returned the
little gnome's hug.  "Your legs are really all right?"
</p><p align=left>"Better than that, honored Cavendish.  My memory has
returned."
</p><p align=left>The boy-naga made a scoffing sound.  "Why not?  Shekinester's
stronger than the stupid old Styx."
</p><p align=left>"And look," said Wheezle.  "Look at this."
</p><p align=left>He held up his wrinkled old hand and made a circling gesture
with his thumb.  A ring of blue light flared into existence where
the tip of his thumbnail traced through the air, then sprang up a
few inches and dropped like a hoop around his index finger.  With
a small rattling noise, it disappeared again.
</p><p align=left>"What was that?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"That was sorcery, honored-but-slow-on-the-uptake Cavendish.
Shekinester's flame burned me clean of Rivi's dust.  I have my
magic back!"
</p><p align=left>"What about the others?  Have you heard anything about them?"
</p><p align=left>Wheezle shook his head, but turned to the nagas who'd brought
him here.  The old female shrugged...or made a motion that would
have been a shrug if she'd had shoulders.  "No one knows how the
Holy Mother will conduct Her tests," she said.  "It may take an
hour, it may take a year.  I can give no better answer."
</p><p align=left>"We don't have a year," I muttered.  "We may not even have an
hour.  Rivi's taken a long headstart, and she's not one to waste
opportunities.  Still," I clapped Wheezle on the back, "you've
got magic, and I've got one shining blood of a sword.  Why don't
we go kick some--"
</p><p align=left>Suddenly, the air ripped open in front of me, spilling out a
stench of sulphur stronger than the vilest pits of Baator.  The
nagas hissed, Wheezle's hands blazed with eldritch energies, and
I whipped my rapier up to attack position.
</p><p align=left>Obliviously, Hezekiah stepped from the reeking rift.  "Hey
Britlin," he said, "see how far I can teleport now?"
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="20"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
20. THREE FLOORS OF MADNESS
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>I wanted to wait for Yasmin, Hezekiah wanted to wait for
Miriam, and surprisingly, Wheezle showed interest in waiting for
our alu-friend, November; but we couldn't afford the delay.  On
another piece of bark, I scratched a note saying that the three
of us had gone ahead...and I hoped Shekinester would release our
companions in time to read the message.
</p><p align=left>The young and old naga watched wordlessly as I propped the
chunk of bark beside the chapel door.  For a moment, I considered
asking them to join against our enemies--heaven knew, we could
use all the help we could get--but what incentive could I offer?
The chance to get shredded by Rivi's wights?  Or perhaps the
possibility of having their minds enslaved by Rivi herself?  The
older naga was almost certainly the mother of the young one, and
would never put him in danger.
</p><p align=left>Instead, I simply gestured for the mother to come nearer.  She
slithered warily across the snow.  "If we fail," I told her in a
low voice, "this area may not be safe in future.  Sigil's on the
other side of that portal, and Sigil may turn ugly.  Talk to your
people about mounting a guard."
</p><p align=left>She stared at me a moment, then nodded.  "Try not to fail,"
she said.
</p><p align=left>Then she and her son slid quietly into the woods.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The interior of the chapel was filled with gloomy thickets of
shadow, but a few shreds of light still managed to slip through
the dirt-crusted windows.  A smell of damp rot hovered in the
air, coming from the clumps of fungus that fed off the long-
unused pews.  Here and there along the walls, a spill of white
showed where snow had blown in through cracks between the stones;
and somewhere close to the front of the sanctuary, a steady drip
told of a leak in the roof.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah's hand clutched at my sleeve.  "November promised
this place wasn't haunted, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah," I said, "correct me if I'm wrong, but you went
through a series of tests in the Court of Light, true?"
</p><p align=left>"I don't want to talk about them," he muttered.
</p><p align=left>"But at the end," I continued, "you must have walked into a
pillar of fire, surrounded by several hundred undead of all
descriptions.  Now you're worried about this little place being
haunted?"
</p><p align=left>The boy cleared his throat uncomfortably.  "I wouldn't exactly
say I walked into the pillar of fire.  I was kind of escorted
there."
</p><p align=left>"Escorted?"
</p><p align=left>"Okay, dragged.  By three vampires, two ghouls, and this big
white thing that kept groaning all the time."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle murmured, "An interesting picture to imagine, honored
Clueless."
</p><p align=left>"Yeah, I screamed so loud, I kind of reduced a banshee to
tears.  My point is, I'm not feeling very friendly toward the
undead right now, so I hope there aren't any hanging their sheets
here."
</p><p align=left>There didn't seem to be.  Apart from a smattering of beetles
sluggish from the cold, the chapel showed no sign of occupation
by creatures on either side of death.  We walked up the central
aisle, eyes and ears open for peril, but all was quiet.  It felt
quiet too: not the least quiver of supernatural menace.
</p><p align=left>Even in the dark, the soft glow of the portal was hard to see.
As November had said, it lay in the doorway between the main
sanctuary and a small sacristy at the back; and it occurred to me
how piking inconvenient it must have been for the worshippers to
have a snake-activated gate right in the middle of their
cloister.  If a priest had a naga tattoo, a serpent brooch, even
a child's creed-school drawing of a pretty python, he'd start
walking into his sanctum and get deposited in the middle of
Sigil.  No wonder this cult had never managed to make a go of
itself.
</p><p align=left>"Where do you think this portal goes?" Hezekiah whispered in
the dark.
</p><p align=left>"The way our luck's been running," I answered, "it could be
the Great Foundry's blast furnace."
</p><p align=left>"Correct me if I'm wrong," Hezekiah said in an annoying tone,
"but you must have walked into a pillar of fire surrounded by
several hundred undead of all descriptions.  Now you're worried
about a little blast furnace?"
</p><p align=left>"Pike it, berk," I growled; and holding my sketch of the
spitting cobra, I stepped through the portal...

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>...and into a spartan room with mildewed walls and a single
barred window.  There was no furniture, simply a heap of limp
straw piled in front of the window.  My nostrils told me the
straw had lain there for some time, long enough to begin a rancid
decline into rot; and other smells mingled with the sharpness of
decay--the thudding aromas of a chamberpot whose slops have gone
unemptied for days.
</p><p align=left>Yet despite the stink of the place, I found myself hushed
solemn by the room's one notable sight.  Seated serenely on the
pile of rotting straw was a venerable female orc, wearing an
ornate satin wedding dress.  At one time the dress must have cost
a hefty sack of jink, for the bodice was stitched with a tasteful
display of beadwork and fine embroidery; but age had yellowed the
fabric and smeared it with copious smudges of unknown origin.
</p><p align=left>The old orc woman showed no sign of embarrassment at the state
of her gown.  Indeed, her face was wreathed in a gentle smile,
and her hands folded placidly in her lap, like an unruffled
debutante waiting to be asked for a dance.  As Wheezle and
Hezekiah stepped through the gate behind me, the orc rose to her
feet and curtsied smoothly, as if people materialized in her
squalid boudoir every day.
</p><p align=left>"Your majesties," she said, "I have awaited your coming for
some time.  Some time.  Some time.  Have you decided which of you
I shall wed?"
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah nearly jumped back through the portal, but I stopped
him in time.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"You are mistaken, honored lady."  Wheezle kowtowed to the orc
with grace enough to match her curtsy.  "We are not of royal
blood, nor are we potential husbands."
</p><p align=left>"Ah, you have come incognito," she smiled.  "I find that
charming.  But I have waited so very long...very long, very
long...it has been hard to keep up my spirits through the cruel
days and nights.  No doubt you were delayed by dragons?"
</p><p align=left>"Something like that," I murmured; but my attention was
elsewhere, scanning the view out the barred and dirty window.  It
showed a wide cobblestone street, a few ramshackle hovels, and a
queue of people--humanoids and others--waiting somberly in dim
twilight before this very building.  Something about that queue
seemed familiar: young adults standing with writhing children;
older adults carrying stretchers where elderly white-hairs lay as
still as corpses; men pleading with monsters only they could see,
and women cringing as if every sound around them was a needle
plunged into their flesh...
</p><p align=left>Suddenly, I recognized it all and knew where we were.  "It's
the Gatehouse," I said to Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>The gnome nodded as if he'd been thinking the same thing, but
Hezekiah asked, "What's the Gatehouse?"
</p><p align=left>"A place for those whose minds are bruised," Wheezle told him.
"It means we have truly returned to Sigil," he added; but his
tone of voice suggested he would prefer the blood-soaked streets
of Plague-Mort to the Gatehouse Asylum.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah's expression said he felt much the same as Wheezle.
"We'd better leave," he muttered.
</p><p align=left>"Your majesties, please!" the orc woman cried.  "You must
not..."  Her agitated voice broke off, and eased once more into a
tranquil smile.  "But of course, you will take me with you."
</p><p align=left>"Honored lady," Wheezle began...but she placed a wrinkled hand
to his lips and shushed him.
</p><p align=left>"I know," she said.  "Gossiping tongues will wag--a young and
vulnerable lass traveling unchaperoned with three lusty princes.
But I have waited...I have waited so long...and people have said
so many cruel things already.  They have tried to tell me...they
have claimed I am...foolish."  Her hands were still folded in
front of her, but the knuckles had turned white as they squeezed
against each other.  "Please, your majesties...I have waited...I
have worn this dress...this dress...I saved every farthing for
this dress because I knew you would come...and marry me..."
</p><p align=left>I couldn't meet her tear-filled gaze.  As I lowered my eyes, I
realized all my clothes were pristine white...as were Wheezle's
robes and Hezekiah's foppishly-tailored outfit.  No wonder she
took us for princes, princes dressed for a wedding day.  When
this poor old woman had seen us, we must have fulfilled her every
confused dream.
</p><p align=left>"What is your name, young miss?" I asked as gently as I could.
</p><p align=left>With another curtsy, she answered, "Irene, may it please your
majesty."  It wasn't an orc name, but then, the white satin gown
was not an orc wedding dress.  Perhaps she fancied herself
human...or perhaps, she had been raised by humans in a manner at
odds with her orc heritage.  Such things happen in Sigil.
</p><p align=left>"Irene," I told her, "my fellow princes and I must go on a
dangerous quest.  It would not be safe for a delicate--"
</p><p align=left>Before I could finish the sentence, she seized my arm.
"Please don't leave me here," she whispered.  "If you leave me
after all this time, I fear I might...go mad...please, don't make
me be a mad old woman..."
</p><p align=left>I turned to Hezekiah and Wheezle.  Both of them were staring
at the floor.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I told her.  "You can come with us a little way."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah offered Irene his arm.  He didn't look comfortable
about it--he held himself as rigid as a steel fencepost, and
never let his eyes stray in her direction-- but the boy was
clearly making an effort to show her courtesy.  Irene didn't seem
to notice his tension; she settled in against him with the
composure of an experienced courtesan taking a baron's hand.
</p><p align=left>The room had only one exit, the doorway that framed the portal
to the Outlands.  I threw away my sketch of the cobra before
leaving--otherwise, I'd find myself back in the chapel.  Wheezle
led the way into the corridor, followed by Hezekiah and Irene,
with me trailing as rear guard...which meant I was the last to
confront the full squalor of the Gatehouse Asylum.
</p><p align=left>The place stank of desperation.  Yes, the smells in my
nostrils were more specific, mildew, slops, and a wispy tang of
blood; but over everything hung an oppressive desolation,
tangible enough to make my skin crawl.  Half the rooms along this
corridor had their doors closed, secured with cast-iron padlocks.
The others had their doors wide open, letting out the whimpers
and moans of their inhabitants.  A few patients had emerged from
their rooms, to lean against the walls and stare vacantly into
the distance, or to stand with eyes closed, rocking and humming
tunelessly in their throats.  One wore an unbuckled straitjacket;
the rest wore unwashed garments, some no better than rags.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle headed for a door at the end of the hall.  Most of the
patients took no notice of us as we passed; those who did covered
their eyes with their hands and shivered until we were gone.
Irene touched one of the shiverers on the shoulder and said in a
gentle voice, "You may have my room, Mazey.  I shall not need it
again."
</p><p align=left>Past the door, we came upon what passed for a nurse's station:
a flimsy wooden table where a bulky young dwarf sat picking his
teeth with a sliver of bone.  He glanced up at us, and his eyes
widened.  "I told you they would come for me," Irene said
triumphantly.  "I told you they would come."
</p><p align=left>He stared for another second or two, then shrugged and went
back to digging between his molars.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Irene's room had been on the third storey; and when we finally
found a stairway, it only went down one floor.  That meant we had
to backtrack along the length of the whole wing before we could
get down to ground level.  I assumed this design made it harder
for barmies to escape, forcing them to run all the way along one
floor, then all the way back on the next floor down, keeping them
inside the building that much longer...but that only worked if
someone tried to stop them from leaving.  As far as I could see,
none of the staff showed the least concern as we passed.  No one
asked who we were or where we were going; no one even recognized
our existence.
</p><p align=left>No one in an official capacity, that is--we got plenty of
attention from the inmates.  Many tried to hide from us; many
more tried to talk to us, in languages that may or may not have
been spoken by anyone else in the multiverse.  A few followed us,
gesticulating as they babbled, and pointing at odd objects:
cracks in the wall, their own teeth, a single red shoe someone
had left in the hallway.  After a while, each lost interest and
wandered off some other direction, still talking and waving
incoherently.
</p><p align=left>Down more stairs and an exit door came in sight--its glass
smudged by the noseprints, gawkers looking in and inmates gazing
out.  A pair of guards in badly scuffed armor leaned against the
wall near the door, passing a flask between them; but they
straightened an inch as they saw us approach.
</p><p align=left>"Yeah?" said the taller one, as if we had asked a question.
She had a sleek crown of black feathers on her head instead of
hair; I couldn't tell if it was a hat or actually part of her
body.
</p><p align=left>"We are leaving, honored guard," Wheezle replied.  "May your
death be everything you hope it to be."
</p><p align=left>"Huh?" Feather-Woman asked.  She must have shone in
conversational skills at the job interview.
</p><p align=left>"Don't mind him," Hezekiah said hurriedly.  "He's a Dustman.
They say things like that."
</p><p align=left>"Dustmen wear gray," observed the other guard.  He had the
head of a tortoise-shell cat, and by the looks of it, his fur
went all the way down.  Unlike most cats, this one hadn't done
much in the way of licking himself clean for a long time.
</p><p align=left>"Alas," Wheezle told the guard, "my gray robes were burned
when a death knight directed me to walk through a pillar of
sacred fire.  These clothes were reconstructed for me by nagas."
</p><p align=left>I cringed.  If Wheezle blurted out everything from the past
few days, these guards would heave us directly into padded cells.
Magic salt-and-pepper grinders, camping out with fiends, getting
chummy with wights on the Plane of Dust, then fighting them in
Plague-Mort...this was not a story to convince people of our
sanity.  "We have to go now," I said, stepping toward the door.
</p><p align=left>Feathers hiked up her foot and planted it against the opposite
wall of the narrow corridor, neatly blocking my exit.  "Pass?"
she grunted.
</p><p align=left>"I beg your pardon?"
</p><p align=left>"She wants to see your pass," the Tortoise-Shell said.  "A
paper what says you can leave."
</p><p align=left>"We don't have a pass," Hezekiah answered, too quickly for me
to stop him.
</p><p align=left>"Gotta have a pass," Tortoise-Shell replied.  "Patients get a
pass from their doc.  Visitors get a pass when they come in."
</p><p align=left>"That's the problem then," Wheezle said.  "We entered the
building through a portal from Plague-Mort.  Well, not directly
from Plague-Mort...from a chapel outside of town, dedicated to
nagas."
</p><p align=left>"Little berk's got a thing about nagas," Feathers observed.
"His doc must have a lot to say about that."
</p><p align=left>"I don't have a doctor," Wheezle snapped.  "We are just
passing through on our way to fight an evil albino."
</p><p align=left>"Albino naga?" Tortoise-Shell asked with interest.  "That's
what you might call a provocative image."
</p><p align=left>"The albino's not a naga," Hezekiah retorted, "she's a
psionic.  She's sucked all the power out of my brain twice, but I
won't let her do it again."
</p><p align=left>"Good thinking," Feathers said.  "I sure hate it when albinos
suck power out of my brain."
</p><p align=left>"If you berks got a thing about albinos," Tortoise-Shell
asked, "why are you all wearing white?  Some self-punishing
identification-with-the-enemy thing?"
</p><p align=left>"They are wearing white," Irene announced, "because they are
three royal princes come to marry me."
</p><p align=left>"All three gonna marry you at once?"
</p><p align=left>"They're princes," Irene answered.  "They can do whatever they
want."
</p><p align=left>"Just the kind of attitude that gives royalty a bad name,"
Tortoise-Shell observed.  "Shame on your highnesses."
</p><p align=left>"Majesties!" Irene corrected.
</p><p align=left>"A prince is Your highness," Feathers said.  "Your majesty is
for kings and queens."
</p><p align=left>"Is that how it works?" Hezekiah asked.  "I always wondered."
</p><p align=left>"They are all majesties," Irene insisted, "because they will
marry me and make me a queen."
</p><p align=left>"Even if they're only princes themselves?"
</p><p align=left>"Maybe," Hezekiah suggested, "if you marry three princes at
once, you become a queen.  It could be cumulative."
</p><p align=left>"All right, that's it!" I snapped.  "Much as my companions
belong in a barmy bin," I told the guards, "we have to get out of
here.  So here's my proof that we aren't really inmates."
</p><p align=left>In a split-second, the tip of my rapier was poised a hair's
breadth from Tortoise-Shell's right eye.  The cat gulped and
froze.  Feathers followed suit.
</p><p align=left>"Follow my logic, if you please," I said.  "Patients surely
aren't allowed to carry weapons, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Right," the guards answered in unison.
</p><p align=left>"I am carrying a very sharp, very lethal sword...right?"
</p><p align=left>"Right," they chorused again.
</p><p align=left>"Therefore, I must not be a patient, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Got me convinced," Tortoise-Shell said, swallowing hard.
</p><p align=left>"Pass, friend," Feathers added, carefully dropping the leg
that barred our way, and nudging the door open.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle smiled and trotted out, followed by Hezekiah.  As
Irene glided regally past the guards, she stopped and whispered,
"Please forgive Prince Britlin's impulsiveness.  He is the
eldest, and has endured many long years of chaste abstinence,
waiting for our union."
</p><p align=left>"Perfectly understandable," Tortoise-Shell answered, now
cross-eyed from staring at the tip of my blade.  "A cutter gets
keen, I can sympathize with that."
</p><p align=left>"Explains all the talk about nagas," Feathers agreed.  "You
have a nice honeymoon now."
</p><p align=left>I kept my sword at the ready as I backed out the door, but the
guards made no rash attempts to nab us.  As we hurried away from
the asylum, I saw Tortoise-Shell raise the flask in our direction
and drink off a hearty toast.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The Gatehouse Asylum imposed its doleful presence on one of
the least desirable zones of Sigil's Hive district...and since a
sensible person would rather play leapfrog with a unicorn than
visit even the best parts of the Hive, you can imagine what a
sordid neighborhood we walked through now.  Beady-eyed kobolds
watched us passing, their boney fists clenching and unclenching
with hate; but there must have been something imposing about our
band--something in Irene's stateliness, or our ethereal white
clothing, or maybe just the gleam of my rapier--that kept the
hostility restricted to venomous glares.  Within minutes, we had
reached the relative safety of a patch of blighted grass, just
outside a fortified Harmonium squad-station.
</p><p align=left>"Do we go in?" Wheezle asked.
</p><p align=left>"I'd prefer to report directly to Lady Erin," I said.  "Our
story is too addle-coved to foist on a Hardhead desk sergeant.
Still, we could beg for an escort between here and the Festhall;
it's coming on night, and we're in a dangerous part of the city."
</p><p align=left>"I might be able to teleport us to the Festhall," Hezekiah
offered.
</p><p align=left>"Back in Plague-Mort," I reminded him, "you said you'd never
tried a jump with more than two people."
</p><p align=left>"I feel stronger now," he answered.  "Since I came out of
Shekinester's flame--"
</p><p align=left>"Save it," I interrupted.  "This is not the time to try
anything risky.  We get some guards, we have them march us across
the city, and we tell Lady Erin what we know.  Let's keep it
simple."
</p><p align=left>Normally, a station like this one would have muscle posted at
the front door, just in case some local bully-boys barged in.  At
the moment we entered, however, the guards had left their post to
take part in a free-for-all behind the front desk.  The cause of
the brouhaha was a gigantic minotaur, fully eight feet tall and
bellowing drunken curses as four of the Harmonium's finest tried
to wrestle him to the ground.  A fifth, the desk sergeant, had
given up on grappling and was bashing the creature's head with a
truncheon; but minotaur heads are noted for horns, not brains, so
the sergeant's cudgel was having precious little effect.
</p><p align=left>"Should we help?" Hezekiah whispered, gaping at the fight.
</p><p align=left>I shook my head.  The Harmonium don't take kindly to
interference from strangers; besides, with so many people
fighting already, we'd just get in the way.  "Wait till they're
done," I told the boy.  "They won't take long."
</p><p align=left>Soon enough, I thought, the minotaur would gore one of the
guards with his bull-like horns; and the moment Harmonium blood
was spilled, the Hardheads would draw their swords and butcher
Mr. Mino like an Aberdeen Angus.  To my surprise, however, no
matter how bubbed up the bull-man appeared, he retained some
particle of prudence: he kept his horns to himself, never giving
the guards an excuse to slice him to ribbons.  Even worse, the
sergeant with the truncheon was more gifted with zeal than
accuracy--he clubbed his own comrades as often as he whacked the
minotaur, thereby keeping the fight even for several minutes.
</p><p align=left>It was only when the guards were finally getting the upper
hand that Hezekiah tugged on the hem of my jacket.  "Britlin..."
</p><p align=left>"Not now," I told him, "I have to talk to the sergeant."
</p><p align=left>The sergeant, hearing my voice now that the ruckus had
subsided, looked up to see who had come in.  His eyes opened wide
with surprise...I told myself a snow-white outfit had that effect
on people.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin, this is important," Hezekiah said, still tugging.
</p><p align=left>"It can wait," I snapped, giving the sergeant a smile of
apology at the interruption.
</p><p align=left>"Honored Cavendish," Wheezle murmured, "perhaps this deserves
your immediate attention."
</p><p align=left>I sighed and held up a finger to the sergeant.  "Back in a
second," I said, and whirled on my companions.  "What?"
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah pointed to a row of six WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE posters
tacked on the wall of the office.  The faces were all too
familiar...but frankly, the pictures must have been drawn by an
untalented chimpanzee, given the abysmal quality of the sketches.
When had I ever had such a protruding forehead?  Why had they
made Wheezle's ears so hairy?  How could they depict a beauty
like Yasmin as a blowsy draggle-tail?
</p><p align=left>On the other hand, the picture of Hezekiah was pretty good.
</p><p align=left>Yes, we were all there...including Miriam and even November.
A hefty bounty rode on all our heads, authorized by "Her Honor
Lady Erin Darkflame Montgomery, and His Worthiness Capt. Sarin
(Harmonium Fact.)."  Apparently, my companions and I had
committed, "Numerous Acts of Sedition, Murther, and Most Grievous
Crimes of Arson on Divers Public Buildings."
</p><p align=left>"Looks like someone is blaming us for Rivi's crimes," I
sighed.
</p><p align=left>"Rivi is setting us up," Hezekiah put in.  "If she's taken
over the brains of influential people..."
</p><p align=left>"I know.  She could easily manufacture a case against us."
</p><p align=left>"But how did she know we'd be here?" Wheezle asked.
</p><p align=left>I shrugged.  "She probably checked the house in Plague-Mort
after the dust had settled.  When she didn't find our bodies, she
concluded we were still alive.  She asked around, discovered we'd
made contact with November, and guessed we'd be heading for
Sigil.  Clever wee Rivi took the time to frame a nasty reception
for when we showed..."
</p><p align=left>A sword point tickled the back of my ear.
</p><p align=left>"...up," I finished.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The guards had clearly decided that arresting three bounty-
paying murderers made better sense than tussling with one garden-
variety drunk.  In fact, they had pressed the minotaur into
temporary deputyship; he was on his feet again, little the worse
for the fisticuffs, and looking keen to take us down if it would
earn a share of the reward.
</p><p align=left>The sword pricking my ear belonged to the desk sergeant, who
showed strict adherence to the Harmonium Book of Clichs by
saying, "Don't move a hair or you're dead."
</p><p align=left>"Why not kill them anyway?" one of the other guards asked.
"The signs say DEAD OR ALIVE."
</p><p align=left>"Because these berks may know where the other three are...and
if they start talking right now, we'll promise not to cut their
throats."
</p><p align=left>"Cut their throats?" Irene repeated.  "How dare you threaten
three royal princes!"
</p><p align=left>"How many princes've you killed, Saul?" one guard asked
another.
</p><p align=left>"Including goblins, kobolds, mephits--upwards of a dozen, I'd
say...and then, there's all the Prime world princelings, but who
counts them?"
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah gulped.  "We're really, really in trouble, aren't
we?" he cried.  With sobs in his throat, he reached out and
grabbed a handful of my shirt, steadying himself on Wheezle's
shoulder.  "After everything we've been through..."
</p><p align=left>The boy blew his nose loudly on my lapel.
</p><p align=left>"Sorry," I apologized to the nearest guard.  "He's Clueless."
</p><p align=left>"He is my prince!" Irene said, stepping forward to lay a
comforting hand on his arm.  "I shall stand by him for eternity."
</p><p align=left>"As will I," Wheezle pronounced.  "Wherever we go, we shall go
together, because we are joined as one."
</p><p align=left>Which offered confirmation, if Hezekiah needed it: the boy now
had physical contact with all four of us.  The next moment, we
were someplace far away from the squad station.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah straightened up with an impish grin on his face.  "I
told you I could teleport us all.  Sorry about the shirt,
Britlin."
</p><p align=left>"It will wash," I answered graciously.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah had teleported us somewhere he knew well: the street
in front of the Mortuary.  Not that it looked much like the place
we had watched a few days earlier; the tenements were nothing but
cinders, with occasional upthrusts of wood that had not burned
completely to ash.  Much of the surrounding pavement had been
washed clean by rainfall--you can always count on Sigil for
drizzle--but some patches of roadway were crusted over with
crumbly residue that I guessed was humanoid skin...bits from the
giant and the Collectors who'd been carrying him, grafted onto
the cobblestones by the flash heat of the explosion.
</p><p align=left>The Mortuary itself showed little of its damage directly; the
masonry had been black to begin with, so the singe marks blended
in.  However, a gridwork of scaffolding had been erected all
around the building, with wooden beams propping up sections of
the roof and walls.  Even if nothing had collapsed immediately,
the Dustmen must not trust the current structural soundness.
</p><p align=left>"It brings tears to my eyes," Wheezle said softly.
</p><p align=left>"Do you want to go inside?" I asked.  "Look up any of your
friends?"
</p><p align=left>"That would not be wise," he answered.  "If Rivi has convinced
the city I am one of those responsible for the fires--including
the explosion here--I will have few friends.  Besides, Rivi might
well station spies in our factions, watching for our return.  I
do not think she could steal the mind of Factol Skall..."
</p><p align=left>"Agreed," I said, remembering my brief encounter with Skall,
as he drained the life from the renegade wight.
</p><p align=left>"But," Wheezle continued, "I cannot reach the factol without
first talking to his aides.  Any one of them may have been
compromised by Rivi."
</p><p align=left>"The same goes for me approaching the Sensates," I said.
"Whom can we trust?"
</p><p align=left>"You can trust me, your majesty!" Irene answered, going down
on one knee.  "I am your humble servant."
</p><p align=left>"Thank you," I smiled, patting her wrinkled hand.  "Your
loyalty is well-pleasing to me."
</p><p align=left>She beamed.
</p><p align=left>"So far as I can see," Hezekiah said, "we have to find Rivi
ourselves.  Find her and defeat her."
</p><p align=left>"Including Kiripao?" I asked.  "Qi and Chi?  A hundred
renegade wights?"
</p><p align=left>"Sure," the boy shrugged.  "Them too."
</p><p align=left>"But honored Clueless," Wheezle said, "we don't even know
where to find Rivi."
</p><p align=left>"That's easy," he answered.  "The Vertical Sea."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>

</p><p align=left>Hezekiah explained his reasoning as we slunk through the Hive
toward the Sea.  "It has a portal to the Glass Spider, right?
And the Spider is Rivi's real base of operations.  So even if she
isn't at the fish-farm right now, I bet she comes and goes
through the gate all the time.  We just watch the place until she
shows up."
</p><p align=left>"Why should she come and go?" I asked.  "Couldn't she take
over some mansion in town?  Just brainwash a wealthy leatherhead
and peel everything he owns."
</p><p align=left>"That would attract attention," the boy answered.  "Wealthy
people have servants and nosy neighbors, not to mention business
competitors spying for any advantage.  Rivi might brain-nap a few
rich vassals, but she won't want anyone to know they're connected
with her--she still has to play things very carefully until she
consolidates her power.  Besides, she needs to secure the
Vertical Sea, whether or not she's using the portal right now.
It's her backdoor out of the city...and an access point for all
her wights, if she ever needs them."
</p><p align=left>"What you say makes sense," Wheezle admitted, "but I cannot
understand how Rivi could enter Sigil in the first place.  All
portals are controlled by The Lady of Pain...who has established
an infallible track record for keeping out destabilizing
influences.  Why didn't The Lady simply close the doors to Rivi?
Let our albino friend plague some other city."
</p><p align=left>"I've been thinking about that," I said, "and I have a theory.
If Rivi couldn't enter Sigil, she'd try someplace else...where
she'd either win or lose.  If she won, she'd become that much
more of a threat; if she lost, the grinders would fall into
someone else's hands, and the mess would continue.  In fact, the
mess might get worse if the person who got the grinders was a
high-powered fiend, something like that.  Perhaps The Lady of
Pain prefers to have Rivi and the grinders here within reach."
</p><p align=left>"Then why doesn't The Lady just kill Rivi now?" Hezekiah
asked.  "Do you think she's afraid of the grinders, like Rivi
said?  Or that The Lady doesn't know where the grinders are?"
</p><p align=left>"It is possible," Wheezle replied, "but more likely, she does
not wish to earn the enmity of other gods.  As I have told
Britlin, the grinders are so supremely dangerous, the pantheons
may unite to destroy any Power who tries to claim them.  The Lady
would surely try to avoid such a threat."
</p><p align=left>"Besides," I said, "it's not The Lady of Pain's style to take
such overt action.  She expects her people to keep the city
streets clean."
</p><p align=left>"Her people," Hezekiah repeated.  "Does that mean she's got a
specially chosen team to deal with threats like Rivi?"
</p><p align=left>"Yes," I told him, "and at the moment, the team is us.  Let's
not pike this up, kid--The Lady of Pain is notoriously
unforgiving toward sods who let her down."
</p>


<hr size=3 noshade width=50% align=center><a name="21"></a>


<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
21. THREE DOWN, ONE TO GO
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>When we reached the Vertical Sea, it was filled with wights:
wights dressed in workers' clothes, wights trundling wheelbarrows
from one level to another, wights whose eyes blazed with utter
fury at the indignity of this pretense.
</p><p align=left>I didn't want to think about what had happened to the real
workers; but I wondered if the fish had fed better than usual
over the past few days.
</p><p align=left>From the vantage of the same tenement roof I'd used before, we
crouched behind the chicken coops and watched the undead stalk
about their business.  For the most part, they stayed at least
three floors above the ground, where their fiery eyes would be
unlikely to attract the attention of passers-by.  Lower down, the
workers were all Rivi's hired goons, dealing directly with the
delivery carts that came to pick up their supplies of seafood.
Lanterns hung at regular intervals throughout the structure, on
the stairs, on the ramps, and on the catwalks over the fish-
tanks...enough light for the tower to be seen thirty blocks away,
and to steal the night vision from anyone who might look in our
direction.
</p><p align=left>While it was impossible to scan the whole twenty-storey
structure, by the end of an hour I had seen no familiar faces: no
Kiripao, no githzerai, and definitely no Rivi.  We'd just have to
cool our heels until they showed up.
</p><p align=left>"So, honored Cavendish," Wheezle murmured, "what is our
strategy now?"
</p><p align=left>"Wait for your enemies," Irene replied calmly, "then strike
from stealth, and claim your plunder."
</p><p align=left>"Hey," said Hezekiah, "look who's a real orc after all."
</p><p align=left>I patted Irene's hand fondly.  "It's a good plan.  If we see
Rivi show up with the grinders and Unveiler, we teleport over and
run a rapier through her gizzard.  Then we grab the trinkets and
teleport away again."
</p><p align=left>"Doesn't sound very heroic," Hezekiah grumbled.
</p><p align=left>"Neither does letting Rivi take over the city."
</p><p align=left>"But couldn't we just jump in front of her and give her the
chance to surrender?"
</p><p align=left>"You mean give her the chance to poach our brains," I
corrected him.  "We can't afford to be charitable, boy."
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah didn't answer, but I could see he wasn't happy with
stabbing people in the back.  I would have liked to have a
different option myself; but the stakes were too high to take
chances.  Maybe--maybe--if I had a clear shot and no risk of
missing, I would club-punch Rivi with the butt of my sword rather
than slicing through her liver.  If I knocked her out, we could
take her prisoner without killing her...but if the first blow
didn't put her down, I'd use my blade as a follow-up, and sod how
much blood I spilled.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Time passed.  Somewhere far in the distance, the Stern Bells
near Sigil's prison chimed antipeak: midnight.  Five hundred
years ago, a Mercykiller sorceress named Justice-by-Fist had
enchanted the bells so they could be heard all over Sigil--not
making them louder, but simply making the sound carry all around
the circle of the city.  True Sigilians could tell where they
were in town, just by the lag between the clockwise and counter-
clockwise passage of the ringing.
</p><p align=left>"Do you think anyone's going to show up tonight?" Hezekiah
asked.  "It's pretty late."
</p><p align=left>The boy was munching a not-quite-ripe peach Wheezle had
procured from a greengrocer in a short trip down to ground level.
Considering that all our pocket money had vaporized in the
Arching Flame, I don't know how Wheezle paid for the fruit...but
a gnome illusionist has resources even when he has no resources,
if you know what I mean.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle, his face the soul of innocence, finished a mouthful
of his own peach and answered the boy's question.  "The people we
seek are more likely to work by night than day, honored Clueless.
We should not give up hope simply because the hour is late."
</p><p align=left>"Before we start getting sleepy," I said, "we should set up a
watch schedule--take turns napping.  It won't be comfortable
bedding down up here..."
</p><p align=left>"I shall make it comfortable for you," Irene announced.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah winced.  Wheezle had more self-control, but his face
paled.  "Honored lady, perhaps we should discuss
certain...misunderstandings between us."
</p><p align=left>"In an arranged marriage," Irene replied, "there are always
adjustments to be made."  She had dribbled peach juice down the
front of her wedding dress, but took no notice of it.  "It simply
requires the husbands and wife to meet each other halfway.  Now,"
she continued, smoothing her gown demurely, "do you want to
decide which of you shall be first, or would you prefer that I
choose?"
</p><p align=left>"First for what?" Hezekiah asked uneasily.
</p><p align=left>"Sounds like the boy needs the most education," I leapt in.
"Start with him."
</p><p align=left>"Yes, yes," Wheezle agreed.  "He is clearly in need of your
guidance, honored lady.  Your lengthy guidance.  Spend several
months if you have to.  Years.  We others can wait."
</p><p align=left>"What are you talking about?" Hezekiah demanded.  "Because it
almost sounds like we're discussing, umm...wedding nights..."
</p><p align=left>"We are," Irene answered serenely.  "Shall we withdraw behind
the chicken coops, your majesty?"
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah's eyes threatened to skitter out of his skull and go
dancing about the rooftop.  He spun away wildly, possibly
summoning his energy to teleport all the way back to the safety
of Uncle Toby's parlor; but the insufferable luck of the Clueless
saved him.
</p><p align=left>"Look!" he cried, pointing a wobbly finger across the street.
"There's Qi...Chi...one of the gith guys!"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah was right.  The githzerai thief--let's call him Chi,
though I never found out which he really was--had reached a point
several storeys below us, climbing one of the Sea's corkscrew
stairways.  The other thugs gave him plenty of space to move up
the steps; even the wights stood clear to let him pass.  The look
on his face showed they were wise to do so: his expression was
gauntly savage, a hailstorm ready to break.  I wondered if he'd
worn that grimace ever since I killed his partner in Plague-Mort,
or if his ferocity had a more recent cause.
</p><p align=left>Not that it mattered.  The only important thing was to capture
the berk and make him tell us which stone Rivi was hiding under.
We'd just teleport across, hold a knife to Chi's throat, and take
him somewhere for interrogation.
</p><p align=left>"Okay, Hezekiah," I whispered, "we keep this simple.  Wait
till he's a good distance from anyone else, then take us right in
behind him."
</p><p align=left>The boy looked like he was going to object, but I stared him
down.  In silence, we watched the githzerai glower his way
upward...heading for the portal to the Glass Spider, I realized.
One level below the portal, he would have to climb a ramp that
crossed above a tank of squid--or calamari, if you prefer--and at
present the area was clear of wights.  "There," I said to
Hezekiah.  "That ramp.  Ready?"
</p><p align=left>He nodded.  I got a good grip on the boy's arm, and Wheezle
grabbed hold of his belt.  "We'll be back soon," I assured
Irene...who waited till the last moment, then laid her hand on
Hezekiah's shoulder before I could stop her.
</p><p align=left>Together all four of us materialized on the ramp--a dozen
paces in front of the githzerai.
</p><p align=left>"Sod it all," I snarled, then charged toward the thief, my
rapier glinting in the lantern light.
</p><p align=left>"Surrender!" Hezekiah shouted to Chi.  "You're outnumbered so
just..."
</p><p align=left>The githzerai whipped out a firewand.
</p><p align=left>"...surrender..." Hezekiah finished lamely.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"It appears we have a standoff," Chi said.
</p><p align=left>I stood, sword ready, three paces away from him, while the
others loomed behind my back.  He held the firewand casually, but
I didn't doubt he could trigger it in a split-second if any of us
moved a hair.
</p><p align=left>"We wouldn't have a standoff," I answered through clenched
teeth, "if someone had landed us behind you."
</p><p align=left>"I didn't want you to kill him," Hezekiah pouted.
</p><p align=left>"I wasn't going to kill him.  I wanted to take him prisoner so
we could interrogate him."
</p><p align=left>"You never told me that."
</p><p align=left>"Do I have to explain everything?" I growled at the boy.  "You
knew he was carrying something magic.  The first time we saw him,
you sensed magic on him."
</p><p align=left>"I didn't know it was a firewand!"
</p><p align=left>"Enough!" Chi roared.  "Do you think you can distract me by
feigning an argument?  I'm not a complete leatherhead, you know."
</p><p align=left>"Feigning an argument," Hezekiah murmured.  "That would have
been clever."
</p><p align=left>"Stop rattling your bone-box!" Chi thundered.  "I'm trying to
decide whether to burn you where you stand."
</p><p align=left>"If you start a fire here," Wheezle said, "you will burn down
the Vertical Sea.  Your portal to the Glass Spider will lose its
anchor and disappear."
</p><p align=left>"The Spider has other portals," Chi answered.  "It's no great
burden to gate into Plague-Mort and head for Sigil from there.
You did exactly that, didn't you?"
</p><p align=left>"It is possible to find an indirect route," Wheezle admitted,
"but would Rivi approve?  She does not seem a woman who tolerates
inconvenience."
</p><p align=left>"If I killed you three once and for all, she'd give me a
medal," Chi answered.  "The slag in the wedding dress is gravy."
</p><p align=left>"Here's an idea," Hezekiah piped up.  "Why don't I just
teleport my friends out of here, and call it a draw?  You don't
set us on fire, and Britlin won't cut out your heart."
</p><p align=left>"Like he did to my partner?" Chi asked sharply.
</p><p align=left>"Actually," I said, "I didn't cut out your partner's heart, I
stabbed through the roof of his mouth and...well, maybe this
isn't the right time to split hairs."
</p><p align=left>"Funny man," Chi glared at me.  "A lot of people have told me
that, Cavendish--you like to make jokes.  Does it surprise you
I've talked to your friends?  I've made it my business to find
out about you, since we met in Plague-Mort.  You won't believe
the stories I've heard...and not one of your acquaintances doubts
you could be a killer.  Like father, like son."
</p><p align=left>I sighed.  "Is this the part where we both taunt each other
into a rage?"
</p><p align=left>"No--rage is overrated."  Chi smiled an ugly smile.  "This is
the part where I kill you in cold blood."
</p><p align=left>I prepared myself to lunge forward: ready for the slightest
lapse in his concentration, a laugh, a moment as he savored his
triumph.  All I needed was the merest instant of distraction; but
Chi was an experienced blood who didn't make stupid mistakes.
The wand in his hand didn't waver an eyelash.  His lips opened to
speak the invocation that would fire his weapon...
</p><p align=left>...and an egg sailed out of nowhere, smashing his face with
yolk.
</p><p align=left>I was almost as surprised as Chi.  Almost.  But while he was
still spitting egg-white from his mouth, my rapier punched clean
through his ribcage, smashing bone fragments into his heart and
lungs.  I kept driving forward, hearing the edges of my blade
scrape against vertebrae as the tip pierced out his back; and I
held him upright on the end of my sword until I could pluck the
firewand from his strengthless fingers.  Then and only then did I
turn across the street to see who threw the egg.
</p><p align=left>On top of the tenement across the street stood three women in
brilliant white.
</p><p align=left>Miriam waved to Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>November leaned coolly against a chimney.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin flexed her fingers and scowled.  "That sodding chicken
pecked my hand."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Thanks for the egg," I shouted to her, then didn't have time
for more conversation.  Six wights had appeared, trundling up
wheelbarrows to harvest squid from the tank below us; but when
they noticed our presence, their eyes blazed like volcanos and
they hissed with delighted fury.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah," I called, "this would be a good time to get us out
of here."  No such luck--the leatherhead boy was still a dozen
paces behind me, and puppyishly waving back to Miriam; he hadn't
even noticed we had undead company.  "Hezekiah!" I roared, even
as the stench of dead flesh and chemicals filled my nostrils.
</p><p align=left>"Hi," I said to the wights, mere inches from my nose.
</p><p align=left>"Hiss," they replied by way of repartee.
</p><p align=left>The first two monsters to reach me had simply abandoned their
wheelbarrows and charged, their claws ripping greedily through
the air.  If one hadn't stumbled over Chi's dead body, I might be
writing these memoirs with a fistful of talons embedded in my
face; but Chi's body sprawled across a good portion of the ramp,
and the wight was too filled with bloodlust to care.  It ran
forward, tripped, and went down, catching itself from a face-
plant only by throwing out its hands.  Those nasty claws struck
the wooden ramp like fourpenny nails, digging deep into the
board...and by the time the creature could pry itself loose, I
had dispatched the other wight with a nicely executed
decapitation.
</p><p align=left>The wight on its knees suffered the same fate, just as it
pulled itself free.  Its head bounced briefly across the ramp,
scattering a trail of red dust; then it toppled over the edge and
into the squid tank below.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah!" I shouted again, but couldn't spare a glance in
his direction.  Another wight was racing up; and this one, her
brain less decayed than her fellows, was still jockeying her
wheelbarrow--a big heavy wheelbarrow, wide enough to block much
of the ramp, and long enough that my blade couldn't reach over
the cart to impale the creature.  Not that she gave me time to
try such an attack: she simply drove straight at me, the
wheelbarrow crunching over assorted corpses on the way, as it
hammered forward like a battering ram.  The ramp gave me no room
to move aside, unless I wanted to swim with the squid...so I took
the only choice left and jumped forward into the wheelbarrow
itself.
</p><p align=left>When I say I jumped, I wish I could claim that I nimbly hopped
into the cart and landed on my feet with panther-like grace.  The
truth was less feline: just as the wheelbarrow was about to bang
into me, I rolled over the front lip and landed lumpishly inside.
</p><p align=left>My rapier was pointed in the right direction, and I stabbed
out with it, just to keep the wight from coming at me with her
claws.  The tip pierced the rotting meat of her shoulder and
sliced off a pound or two.  She hissed in pain, and heaved on the
wheelbarrow handles with supernatural strength...or more
precisely, she heaved on one of the handles--the other arm,
injured by my sword thrust, didn't have nearly the same amount of
muscle.  One side of the wheelbarrow went up, the other scarcely
moved at all, and I found myself tipping sideways out of the
cart, staring down at a school of eagerly waiting squid.
</p><p align=left>"Gack!" I commented; and trying not to drop my sword or gash
myself on its blade, I scrambled to grab the edge of the
wheelbarrow cart before I plunged straight into the water.  My
fingers found purchase, splinters found my fingers, and I stopped
my immediate fall.  The wight kept heaving sideways, however, and
my feet slid out of the cart, slipped past the edge of the ramp,
and plunked knee deep into the tank.
</p><p align=left>So here's the picture--I'm dangling over the side of the ramp,
one hand clutching the cart, the other aiming my sword in the
wight's direction to discourage the monster from lunging for
me...and a crowd of squid are caressing my feet with their
suckered tentacles, trying to decide if I'm edible.  "You can't
eat me raw!" I called down to them.  "You have to marinate, then
simmer for a few hours or I'll be all rubbery."
</p><p align=left>The wight hissed.  "Everyone's a critic," I muttered.  Then I
noticed that the wight was hissing because its body had been
hacked lengthwise from shoulder to crotch by a familiar-looking
longsword.  A white-shod foot kicked the bisected wight off the
ramp, much to the culinary appreciation of the squid; and moments
later, another white-clad woman with ridiculously puny wings
tucked her hands under my armpits and flew me up to a solid
footing.
</p><p align=left>"Thanks," I said to November, then "Thanks," again to Yasmin
who was dealing with the remaining wights.  "I take it you flew
across?"
</p><p align=left>"Why not?" November answered, folding her wings back flat
across her shoulders.  "I've never been fond of barrow wights."
</p><p align=left>I buried my face in my hands and groaned.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"More company," Yasmin called, as a dozen new wights clattered
up a spiral staircase from the next floor down.
</p><p align=left>"Pike this nonsense," Miriam growled.
</p><p align=left>She bent and picked up Chi's firewand, something I'd dropped
in the course of my gymnastics on the wheelbarrow.  Before I
could guess what she was up to, she shouted "In nomine Vulpes!"
</p><p align=left>The wand loosed a crackling fireball straight into the wight's
faces.
</p><p align=left>"What the sod are you doing?" I cried.  To be sure, the wights
had abruptly ceased to be a threat--in fact, with all the
chemicals used to resurrect them, their bodies burned as if they
had been doused with Phlegistol.  One fell off the ramp and into
a fish-tank two storeys below, releasing a gush of steam as thick
as a pea-soup fog.  The rest simply blazed down to ash in
seconds, oil-soaked torches burning in the night...and all around
them, the Vertical Sea burned too, a framework of age-old wood.
</p><p align=left>"Honored Miriam," Wheezle said, "while you should be
congratulated for guessing the firewand's invocation--"
</p><p align=left>"No trick there," Miriam interrupted.  "The Fox used the same
phrase for every wand he made--the old sod had a real bee for
mass production."
</p><p align=left>"Still," Wheezle continued, "one cannot help noticing that
your fire has cut off our route to the ground."
</p><p align=left>"It's cut off the wights too," Miriam answered.  "We won't
have to worry about those berks anymore.  If you're worried about
getting away, November can fly some of us out, and the Kid can
teleport the rest to safety.  What's the problem?"
</p><p align=left>"In polite company," I told her, "we don't use city monuments
for kindling.  On the other hand, we can discuss that after
Hezekiah...Hezekiah?"
</p><p align=left>The boy had slumped to his knees and was pressing his hands
against his head.  "Rivi's trying to blank me again," he wailed.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"I'll kill that slag!" Miriam roared, flourishing the firewand
with homicidal intent.  But the nasty wee albino was nowhere in
sight...not that we had much of a view of our surroundings.  With
so many ramps, tanks, and support beams in the way, we had no
clear line of sight to any of the other levels in the tower; and
to make matters worse, smoke from the burning stairway had
drifted in around us, stinging our eyes and reducing visibility
to only a few paces.
</p><p align=left>"November!" I shouted, "start flying people out of here.  Take
Irene first..."
</p><p align=left>"Who's Irene?" the alu asked.
</p><p align=left>"I am Irene," the old orc answered serenely, "betrothed bride
to these three noble princes."
</p><p align=left>"Do tell," Yasmin said.  "You've been a busy boy, Britlin."
</p><p align=left>"Can we start the evacuation?" I snapped.  "The Sea's on fire,
Hezekiah's in trouble, and..."
</p><p align=left>The boy howled with fury and pounded his hands against his
temples.  "I am not...in...trouble!"
</p><p align=left>He threw his head back and screamed, the kind of scream used
by martial artists the instant they drive their fist through a
brick wall.  A moment later, the cry was echoed from somewhere
overhead: a woman's shriek, poisoned with outrage.
</p><p align=left>"I beat her!" Hezekiah crowed.  He threw his head back to
stick out his tongue in the direction of the woman's cry.
"Three's the charm, Rivi!" he called.  "You may think you're
tough, but I've been incinerated by a goddess.  You'd better not
mess with Hezekiah Virtue or I'll...uh-oh."
</p><p align=left>Hurtling down through the smoke came Kiripao, brandishing
Unveiler and coated from head to toe in brown dust.  "Peel it!"
he screamed.  "Peel away the shell!"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The elf monk struck Hezekiah feet first in the chest.  It was
a glancing blow, but still enough to knock the boy backward.
Hezekiah wheezed, trying to force his lungs to draw breath, then
toppled off the ramp into the tank.
</p><p align=left>Miriam shouted a curse and raised the firewand toward Kiripao.
She might have blasted him then and there, catching all of us in
the radius of the fireball; but the monk sprang forward the
moment he struck the ramp, and bolted straight at Miriam before
she could speak the invocation.  He swung Unveiler at Miriam's
head, a whipcrack strike that would have crushed her skull if she
hadn't thrown up her arm to block.  Bones cracked as the scepter
smashed her forearm; and she shied back a step, trying to bring
the firewand to bear on her screaming opponent.
</p><p align=left>Kiripao didn't give her time--he had been fast before, but the
umbral insanity had keyed him to a fever pitch, removing every
inhibition and giving him a lust to inflict pain.  He followed up
the scepter smash with a snap kick that caught Miriam flush on
the floating ribs.  Breath whoofed out of her and she flew
backward off the ramp, moving so fast I feared she might be
knocked clear of the squid-tank and fall nine storeys to the
ground; but Miriam was a tough old basher, one who could take a
few hits without letting it rattle her.  Somehow she managed to
snag her foot on the rim of the tank as she hurtled by, then gave
herself a backward thrust.  Instead of going over the side, she
splashed into the water, sending dozens of squid into panic.  The
tank began to fill with their ink, an opaque blackness that hid
both Miriam and Hezekiah sinking beneath the waves.
</p><p align=left>"Kiripao, you fool!" Rivi shouted from the level above us.  I
could see her garishly painted face peering over a catwalk--the
catwalk leading to the Plane of Dust portal.  She and Kiripao
must have come from the Glass Spider, possibly to meet with Chi;
and when the fighting started, the ever-impulsive elf had decided
to break a few heads himself.  "Kiripao!" Rivi continued, "I
command you to get back up here."
</p><p align=left>Easy for her to say...but our side had recovered from the
confusion of Kiripao's sneak attack.  Now Yasmin and I stood
shoulder to shoulder, our swords ready for blood.  Smoke roiled
around us.  In the tank below, water thrashed and churned, a
sound I hoped meant Miriam was swimming to help Hezekiah.  Even
if the noise was actually my friends being dragged under by
squid, I knew what my first duty was.  This fiasco had to end
now.
</p><p align=left>"Kiripao," Yasmin said in a cold voice, "you have one chance:
put down Unveiler and surrender.  I consider you diseased, not
evil...but I would not hesitate to kill a rabid dog.  The choice
is yours."
</p><p align=left>The monk's eyes glittered, reflecting the fire that crackled
behind our backs.  I could not read the expression on his
face--did he even understand what Yasmin had said?
</p><p align=left>"Get up here!" Rivi snarled.
</p><p align=left>"You saw what she did to Petrov," Yasmin told the elf.  "You
know she'd do the same to you, just for amusement.  Put down the
scepter."
</p><p align=left>Kiripao's gaze dropped and he looked at Unveiler with
surprise...as if he hadn't realized he was carrying anything more
than a convenient weapon for clubbing people.  He held it up,
like a curious object he'd just found lying at his feet;
firelight glinted off its surface, throwing beads of ruby
illumination across his face.
</p><p align=left>"Peel," he whispered.  "Peel it!  PEEL IT ALL AWAY!"
</p><p align=left>I tensed, waiting for him to charge...but Kiripao's brain
brimmed with the pus of umbral thoughts, and forthright attack
was not the umbral way.  He feinted toward us, then spun off in
the opposite direction, up the ramp.  Perhaps he was responding
to Rivi's summons after all; perhaps he was simply looking for a
shadowy spot to lie in ambush.  Either way, he never made it--two
steps before he reached the stairs to the next level, he ran
smack into something invisible.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin and I had raced after our quarry as soon as he ran.  We
had no hope of catching him--the monk moved as fast as a
ferret--but we were close enough to see what happened next.
Kiripao swung Unveiler at whatever he had bumped into; and two
gnarled little hands flickered into visibility as they deflected
the strike.
</p><p align=left>"Honored Madman," said the owner of those hands, "this scepter
is an abomination.  It must return to the keeping of my faction."
</p><p align=left>With a strength I had never suspected, Wheezle yanked down
Unveiler, pulling Kiripao's whole upper body with it.  The monk's
mouth flopped open in surprise; and while Kiripao was gaping,
Wheezle jerked the scepter up again, driving it into the
underside of Kiripao's jaw.  Teeth clacked together hard, and
Kiripao's tongue must have got in the way--the monk spat blood,
splattering Wheezle's face and dribbling more down his own chin.
</p><p align=left>"Peel it," he gurgled, the pronunciation fuzzed by his wounded
tongue.  "Peel it hard!"
</p><p align=left>Wheezle struggled to twist Unveiler out of Kiripao's hands,
but the monk simply smiled--a smile with blood-smeared teeth.  He
lifted the scepter, with Wheezle clinging fiercely to it, and
swung it at high speed over the edge of the ramp.  His intention
was obviously to play crack-the-whip: spin Wheezle out, then give
Unveiler a vicious snap that would send the gnome flying free.
Wheezle would fly a long way; they had moved far enough up the
ramp that the squid tank was no longer beneath them.</p><p align=left>The drop
was now a full nine storeys down to the cobblestone street.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle's feet lifted off the ramp as Kiripao swung the
scepter.  His body swept out to the horizontal, but he maintained
his grip, hands clenched on the artifact he called an
abomination--to a Dustman, death was far less terrible than what
Unveiler could do to an undead soul.  Kiripao gave the scepter a
snapping jerk to throw Wheezle free...but the little Dustman
found some well of strength as deep as death itself and clung on
despite the jolt to his wrists.
</p><p align=left>Kiripao had never imagined the gnome would keep hold.  Brother
Monk had thrown everything he had into the snap; now he was off-
balance, Wheezle's weight dragging him forward to the edge of the
ramp.  For a split-second, Kiripao fought to keep his feet...then
both he and Wheezle were plunging away from the tower, hurtling
toward the ground.
</p><p align=left>"November!" I shouted.  But the alu had already taken to her
wings, swooping after the two with every scrap of speed she
possessed.  Time blossomed the way it sometimes does when you can
only watch the inevitable.  November sped like a sling bullet
through the smoke, through the darkness; and I could see she
would make it, she was right on target.  Her arms reached
forward, one aiming for Wheezle, one for Kiripao...
</p><p align=left>...and Kiripao lashed out a fist as hard as iron, hooking
around November's head and smashing into her closest wing.
</p><p align=left>The wing bones didn't just break, they shattered...as if they
had always been as flimsy as twigs and someone had finally called
their bluff.  The other wing, still intact, spread wide as
November reflexively tried to use it as a brake; but its effect
was minimal, providing no more than a meagre ability to steer.
All three, gnome, elf, and alu plummeted downward.
</p><p align=left>Just before impact, Kiripao threw out his arms and gave a
single flap, as if he had an umbral's wings to pull out of the
dive.  He didn't; and with a last sweep of her good wing,
November twisted the falling group so that Kiripao took the brunt
of the crash.
</p><p align=left>The crunch was loud enough to hear nine storeys above.
</p><p align=left>Thanks to her last second maneuver, November came out on top
of the heap.  After a few moments, she rolled off the other two
and onto the cobblestones, clutching her belly as if she'd
ruptured something.  Her good wing jerked back into place across
her shoulders; her bad wing trailed out across the pavement like
some limp cloth streamer barely attached to her body.  She made a
weak gesture in our direction, but at that distance, I couldn't
understand what she meant.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle stirred.  His fall had been broken by Kiripao beneath
him, but he'd still had November squash down on his body from
above.  As the gnome pulled himself off the motionless monk, I
saw that his legs were dragging uselessly behind.
</p><p align=left>"Oh Wheezle," Yasmin whispered.  "Your spine again?"
</p><p align=left>There was no way to tell how badly he was injured.  But the
little gnome still held Unveiler, even as he crawled to the
street curb and propped himself up so he could face the Vertical
Sea.
</p><p align=left>I looked down at the lower levels of the tower.  Every wight
had stopped in its tracks...waiting, watching Wheezle.
</p><p align=left>The gnome raised the scepter.  "Hoksha ptock!" he shrieked,
his voice so piercing it echoed over and over again from the
surrounding tenements.
</p><p align=left>Unveiler erupted with sickly green radiance, blindingly bright
against the darkness of the street.  The faces nearby were lit as
clearly as day, November grimacing, Wheezle stone-faced with
determination...and Kiripao, blood trickling darkly from his
nose.  The extra illumination made it easy to see the unnatural
angle between Kiripao's head and body.  I had seen such an angle
once before: at a public hanging.
</p><p align=left>"Hoksha ptock!" Wheezle shrieked again.
</p><p align=left>From every level of the Vertical Sea came the sound of wights
hissing.  "Sssss...sssss."  They had started rocking, wavering in
unison as the glow of Unveiler intensified.  "Sssss...sssss."  A
hundred wights swayed together on the burning tower; I could feel
shivers through my feet as the tower itself vibrated in
synchrony.  Wights above, wights below.  "Sssss...sssss."
</p><p align=left>The living thugs, down on the lowest levels, had begun to flee
for the street.  Given the fire and the behavior of the wights,
they must have decided their jobs with Rivi were terminated.
Those who reached the pavement first didn't spare a second glance
at Wheezle or the others; they simply ran, disappearing into the
impenetrable warrens of the Hive.
</p><p align=left>"Sssss...sssss.</p><p align=left>Sssss...sssss."
</p><p align=left>Wheezle held Unveiler over his head, the scepter's metal
blazing like a small green sun.  My mind went back to Petrov,
holding the same scepter and consumed with anti-magic fire; for
the first time, I wondered if Unveiler might be burning hot in
the little gnome's hands.  He showed no sign of pain--nothing but
an iron-clad resolve to finish what he had started.
</p><p align=left>"Hoksha ptock!" Wheezle said.  This time he didn't shout; but
his words carried just the same, resounding the full twenty
storeys of the tower.
</p><p align=left>Every wight turned to ectoplasm in the blink of an eye.
</p><p align=left>Floods of ectoplasm spilled down the ramps, down the stairs,
splashing into the fish-tanks to form gooey slicks on the water,
slopping in cascades down to the pavement, plopping in huge drops
on our heads, our shoulders.  Runnels of it poured into the fire;
and like fuel oil, the fluid ignited into a blue-hot blaze, the
flames racing up the ectoplasmic streams faster than the liquid
could fall.  In seconds, the fire had spread to a dozen other
levels of the tower, spewing greasy smoke as it fed on the
wights' last remains.
</p><p align=left>Wheezle slumped back limply against the curb.  Unveiler slid
from his strengthless hand.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"Wheezle!" Yasmin cried.
</p><p align=left>Her voice choked off as a sudden gust of smoke billowed up
from the floor beneath us.  Not only did the smoke make it
impossible to see the ground, it brought home the precariousness
of our own situation.
</p><p align=left>"We have to get out of here!" I shouted, as flames roared from
below.
</p><p align=left>"Say, there's an idea!" Yasmin replied.  "Why didn't I think
of it?"
</p><p align=left>We turned back to our companions.  Only Irene was still
standing on the ramp, and she had calmly lowered the train of her
bridal gown into the tank to let Miriam climb out.  Miriam fought
to extricate herself and Hezekiah from a weight of squid now
attached to both their bodies; but Yasmin and I rushed forward to
help, jabbing our swords carefully to persuade tentacles to let
go.  In seconds, Miriam had wrenched herself all the way out, and
together we hauled Hezekiah onto the ramp with us.
</p><p align=left>"He's out cold," Miriam muttered, giving the boy a few sharp
whaps on the face.  "Still breathing though."
</p><p align=left>"Kiripao hit him pretty hard," I replied.  "Harder than the
kid could take, anyway.  I'll carry him."
</p><p align=left>"No," Miriam said, "I will."
</p><p align=left>I didn't fight her for the honor--a sopping wet Clueless was
not something I really wanted to throw over my shoulder.  Miriam,
however, was already soaked to the skin, so carrying the kid
wouldn't drench her further.
</p><p align=left>"You grab the boy," Yasmin nodded to Miriam, "and then let's
peel it.  Britlin, show Irene the way to the portal."
</p><p align=left>"The portal?" I shuddered.
</p><p align=left>"It's the only way out," she said.  "Hezekiah can't teleport.
November can't fly up to us with that broken wing.  There are a
dozen fires between us and the ground, not to mention the entire
tower's going to fall any second.  Up to the portal before it all
tumbles down!"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The first tank fell as Irene and I were coming to the top of
the stairs.  It came from a few levels below us, down where the
fire had been burning the longest; a huge vat of water and fish
breaking through its weakened supports and crashing down onto the
next level.  The whole tower quaked with the force of the
impact--I couldn't see the extent of the damage, but I could hear
the cracking of timbers, and feel the sudden bend as the tower
pitched out of balance.  Only quick reflexes allowed me to grab
the stair railing with one hand and Irene with the other.
</p><p align=left>"Your majesty is most eager," Irene smiled.
</p><p align=left>"Sure am," I muttered under my breath.  "This is exactly how I
pictured a honeymoon would be."
</p><p align=left>As we stepped onto the next catwalk, however, I sighed with
relief.  I had half-expected to see Rivi waiting for us,
brandishing yet another of the Fox's firewands; but the nasty wee
albino was nowhere in sight.  No doubt she had retreated through
the portal as soon as the fire hit the fan.
</p><p align=left>This level of the tower had less smoke than the one below, but
our visibility was still obscured--wisps of steam rose off the
tank of dogfish below us, as the fires beneath heated the water.
A tank that size would take ages to come to a boil, but already
the little sharks were darting about in agitation, thunking
desperately against the tank walls.  Their fear churned the
surface, splashing hot water across the boards of the cat-walk.
</p><p align=left>"Don't worry," I assured Irene, "we're almost safe.  Just
ahead there's a portal that will take us out of here."
</p><p align=left>I didn't mention that a homicidal psionicist could be lurking
on the other side, waiting to trample our brains.  Nor did I
mention that Rivi might have more wights with her, or thugs, or a
firewand, or other lethal tricks we hadn't seen yet.  I thought
those were our only concerns...until Irene brought up an issue
that had completely slipped my mind.
</p><p align=left>"And what," she asked, "is the key to this portal?"
</p><p align=left>"Key," I said.  "Key.  Yes.  We need a key."
</p><p align=left>The key to this portal was, of course, a picture of oneself.
I didn't have such a thing.  I doubted my companions would
either--they all wore naga-spun clothing, so I had to assume that
all their possessions had burned when they entered the Arching
Flame.  Yasmin's sword must have had enough magic to survive,
just as mine did; but everything else was gone, cinders, smoke.
</p><p align=left>"Sod it all!" I muttered.  No paper, nothing to draw with...oh
yes, in time the tower would be a plentiful source of charcoal,
but by then we'd be charcoal too.  Could I use the tip of my
rapier to scratch out on image on a chunk of wood?  Maybe, if I
had a useful chunk of wood; but the Vertical Sea was built of
stout beams and planks, and nothing close to hand was thin enough
to chop or pry loose.
</p><p align=left>Think, Britlin, think.  How do you make a picture when you
can't make a picture?
</p><p align=left>"Okay," I told myself.  "Other artists do this all the time.
Nothing to it."  Turning to Irene, I bowed deeply.  "Your pardon,
good lady, but I require a swatch of your gown."
</p><p align=left>"Ahh," she said, a gleam in her eye.  "You are so bold."  She
didn't flinch as I lifted my rapier and sliced out a section of
cloth the size of my hand, taken from the bottom front of the
dress.
</p><p align=left>White satin of the finest silk, smeared with unidentifiable
smudges of brown and green.  Lovely.
</p><p align=left>"Now, milady, a lock of your hair."
</p><p align=left>She lifted an eyebrow, but there was a smile on her face.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>By the time the others arrived--Miriam cradling Hezekiah's
unconscious body, while Yasmin kept her steady whenever the tower
shuddered--I had assembled a somber montage on the catwalk in
front of me.
</p><p align=left>A scrap of stained silk, frayed on the edges.
</p><p align=left>A few weedy strands of gray hair.
</p><p align=left>A shred of Irene's veil, covering the hair.
</p><p align=left>Four thin splinters of wood shaved off the catwalk, lined up
side by side on the white cloth; one of the splinters was partly
broken halfway down, canted off at an angle.
</p><p align=left>"Britlin," Yasmin scowled, "what do you think you're doing?"
</p><p align=left>"I'm making a portrait of Irene.  It's an abstract."
</p><p align=left>"Oh."  Yasmin leaned over my shoulder.  "It needs a teardrop."
</p><p align=left>"I know it needs a teardrop!" I snapped.  "Any fool can see it
needs a teardrop."  Pause.  "Where does it need a teardrop?"
</p><p align=left>"On the veil," Yasmin and Miriam said in unison.
</p><p align=left>"Okay."  I bent over the catwalk and reached down toward the
fish-tank.
</p><p align=left>"What are you doing now?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"I'm going to dip my finger in the vat.  Get some water, get a
teardrop."
</p><p align=left>"That just gives you a water drop, Britlin."  Yasmin sighed.
"You're making art--you want to ruin it?"
</p><p align=left>"Men!" Miriam muttered under her breath.
</p><p align=left>"Fine!" I said.  "Irene, can you produce a teardrop?"
</p><p align=left>"A sad tear or a happy one?"
</p><p align=left>I turned to other two women.  "Your opinion, ladies?"
</p><p align=left>Before they could answer, another vat of fish fell off the
tower.  This one started three stories above us: smashing down to
the next lower level, then angling off a slanted beam that tipped
the tank sideways and deflected it to the rear of the structure.
Several tons of water and confused lobsters streamed past us in a
thunderous cataract, followed by the heavy vat itself.
</p><p align=left>"No point getting picky about the type of tear," Yasmin said
quickly.
</p><p align=left>"Yeah," Miriam nodded.  "The leatherheaded portal can't tell
the difference."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Like many a bride, Irene had a ready source of tears; happy or
sad, I couldn't say.  She took almost no time to deposit a lady-
like dewdrop on the veil of my collage...and speed was good,
considering the ominous creaks now wracking every inch of the
tower.  The Vertical Sea's lifetime could be measured in minutes,
if not seconds, and we fervently hoped to relocate before it
collapsed.
</p><p align=left>I spared a last glance at our comrades down below on the
street, and was relieved to see November dragging Wheezle into a
nearby alley.  She could barely stand, her body doubled over with
the pain of her own injuries; yet the look of determination on
her face showed she would get the gnome to safety before the
tower came crashing down.  They were still in serious danger--in
the Hive at night, with a price on their heads--but they would
not die in an avalanche of lumber and boiled prawn.
</p><p align=left>Now to make sure we didn't die either.  "Irene," I said,
putting the collage carefully into the orc-woman's hands, "you're
going to lead us through the portal now.  You're holding the
key."
</p><p align=left>I hoped I was telling her the truth.  Yasmin and Miriam might
believe a few scraps could substitute as a portrait, but I was
far from convinced.  Yes, the assemblage suggested a deluded
bride--dirty silk, a broken splinter, an ambiguous tear--but was
it enough?  Would the portal accept a depiction that was at most
vaguely evocative?  Or did its magic require a clean
representation of face, flesh, and bone?
</p><p align=left>A beam overhead gave a loud crack as flames licked around its
girth.  "Go ahead, Irene," I said, swallowing hard.  "I'm sure
this will work."
</p><p align=left>"Of course, your majesty," she answered with a small curtsy.
Showing no doubt at all, she walked toward the dim outline of the
portal, the rest of us following behind...
</p><p align=left>...and the portal opened.
</p><p align=left>Dust skirled around us, buffeting our cheeks.  The wind had to
come from the Glass Spider itself--air leaking out, or perhaps
deliberately sprayed to keep dust from accumulating around the
entrance.  Putting my arm around Irene to keep her on her feet, I
pushed forward against the gale, unable to see if the door in
front of us was open.  It was; and as soon as we had fought our
way inside, it slid shut with a hiss, closing off the rasping
rush of the duststorm.
</p><p align=left>"How about that!" I said to the others.  "The sodding collage
actually worked.  The portal thought it was a picture of Irene!"
</p><p align=left>"This is a picture of me?" she asked, looking down dubiously
at the scrap of cloth, the hair, the wood splinters.
</p><p align=left>"Absolutely," I told her, laughing with relief.  "We got
approval straight from the portal's mouth."
</p><p align=left>"Then," she said graciously, "I must add this to my hope
chest...to complement my other portrait."  She reached into her
bodice and withdrew a cheap tin locket.  "See this?"  She opened
the locket to show me a tiny watercolor of herself, perhaps
thirty years younger.  "Rather a good likeness, don't you think?"
</p><p align=left>I looked at the watercolor, then at the collage, then at the
watercolor again.  Don't ask me which was the better
portrait--ask the sodding portal.

<p align=center><font color=red face="Exocet" size=+1>
22. THREE TIMES THE BANG FOR THE BERK
</font></p>
</p><p align=left>  
</p><p align=left>Miriam laid Hezekiah on the floor of the entrance area...not
far from the smear of blood where we'd found the dead hobgoblin
the first time we came to the Glass Spider.  "How is he?" Yasmin
asked.
</p><p align=left>"Still breathing," Miriam replied, trying to sound
unconcerned.  "He'll come around when he's ready."
</p><p align=left>"And what do we do in the meantime?"
</p><p align=left>"The last time we were here," I said, "you talked about a
portal to Mount Celestia."
</p><p align=left>"Yeah," Miriam nodded.  "The place is supposed to be boring as
a beadle, but at least no one will slip a dagger into your
kidneys."
</p><p align=left>"And Mount Celestia has gates to Sigil?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>"Every plane has gates to Sigil," I said.  "We'll find
something."  I glanced back at Miriam.  "Have you ever visited
Mount Celestia?"
</p><p align=left>She shook her head without meeting my gaze.  "Didn't think I'd
be welcome.  They, uhhh...the Mount Celestials have a reputation
for hunting down evil."
</p><p align=left>"You are not evil," Irene said without hesitation, "you are
simply gruff.  It is unfair to judge people as wicked, just
because...they are gruff."
</p><p align=left>I got the feeling our orc friend was speaking of someone other
than Miriam; but she suddenly shifted her bridal veil and lowered
it over her face, turning away as she did.  Whatever submerged
pain had bubbled to the surface, she didn't want to share it.
</p><p align=left>There was a brief but awkward silence.  Finally, Yasmin said,
"Whatever any of us might have been, we aren't evil now.  There's
only one true evil in the Glass Spider, and that's Rivi."
</p><p align=left>"She's probably not in the Spider any more," Miriam muttered.
"Odds are she's done a flit out one of the other portals...and
not to Mount Celestia."
</p><p align=left>"Do you really think she'd run?" I asked.  "I doubt she's
desperate enough yet to abandon a posh base like the Glass
Spider.  Who could she possibly believe would track her here?  No
one but us--we were the only people close enough to get through
the portal before the Vertical Sea collapsed.  Do you think
Rivi's afraid of us?"
</p><p align=left>"She should be," Yasmin replied, drawing her sword.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>It only took another minute to formulate a plan.  Miriam would
carry Hezekiah to the Mount Celestia portal, and wait for us
there with Irene.  Yasmin and I would scour the rest of the
building for Rivi; we would take appropriate action if we found
her.  Neither of us expected the job to be that simple, but we
knew we had to try: Yasmin in the cause of Rightful Entropy, me
on behalf of Wheezle, November, and Oonah DeVail.
</p><p align=left>Time to get on with it.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin and I started with a circuit of the Spider's upper
floor--rooms full of the wights' chemical smell, but empty of
opposition.  Puzzling; but then, in the past few days, we had
whittled down the numbers of Rivi's bashers, both the living and
the undead.  The personnel needed to work the Vertical Sea must
have exhausted the rest of her crew.  To all appearances, there
was no one left in the whole of the Glass Spider...either that,
or they were all waiting in ambush on the lower floor.
</p><p align=left>Outside the windows of the Spider, the infinite Plane of Dust
lay quiet and gray.  Patient.  Ashes to ashes...
</p><p align=left>When we had assured ourselves the top floor was clean, we
headed for the stairs to the basement.  There was only one
staircase to the bottom level, a perfect spot to set a trap; and
considering how the Fox mass-produced firewands, Rivi must surely
have kept one for herself.  Even so, we descended the steps
without incident, down to the spartan utility corridors that
echoed with the throb of machinery.
</p><p align=left>"Maybe Rivi doesn't know we're coming for her," Yasmin
murmured.
</p><p align=left>"Or maybe she died laughing at the thought," I replied.
</p><p align=left>"If we find her dead, we'll muss up her corpse and say we
killed her," Yasmin smiled--a beautiful, pure smile, as if for
this one second in all eternity, we were together.  I don't know
if we were together as lovers, as brother and sister, as
comrades-in-arms...and for that one second in all eternity, it
didn't matter.
</p><p align=left>One second in all eternity: most people don't even have that.
</p><p align=left>She smiled again...and I opened my mouth to say something, I
don't know what, I'll never know what, when she turned away from
me and put out a hand to steady herself against the corridor
wall.  The gesture didn't seem out of place--I thought she just
wanted to stop me from speaking, to let the moment last a little
longer without being spoiled by words.  That's why I held back,
giving her time with her thoughts.
</p><p align=left>Perhaps thirty seconds passed, and still she stood there, head
slightly lowered, hand against the wall...until finally, a needle
of fear worked under my skin and I stepped around to look her in
the eye.  "Are you all right?"
</p><p align=left>She didn't answer right away, but finally she lifted her head,
eyelids flickering.  "I'm fine, darling," she answered.  "Quite,
quite well.  In fact, I'd be completely on top of the world if
you'd kiss me."
</p><p align=left>Another wide smile swept across her face as she stepped toward
me and draped an arm over my shoulder.  She leaned forward with
her lips slightly parted, but I held up a hand to stop her.
"Before you kiss a Sensate," I said, "you have to remember that
our perceptions are...heightened through intensive training.  We
have a better sense of smell..."  I touched her nose lightly with
my forefinger.  "A better sense of hearing."  I brushed her
earlobe.  "Extremely keen vision...not just for seeing, but for
observing.  For staring at a beautiful woman, and taking in every
nuance."
</p><p align=left>"Do you see any nuances that...interest you?"  Her voice was
throaty.
</p><p align=left>"Definitely.  A minute ago, your smile started in your eyes
and bloomed through your whole face.  Now, it's only your mouth
that's smiling.  Your eyes are as cold as the ninth level of
Hell."
</p><p align=left>She swung her sword, but I had my own blade ready, easily
parrying the attack.  Skittering back a few steps, she graced me
with a glittering leer.  "What a clever boy!  Who would have
guessed your wee male brain wouldn't be completely blinded by
animal lust?  Once I've made this tiefling slag my own, I must
have you on my side too."
</p><p align=left>The voice came from Yasmin's lips...but of course, it wasn't
Yasmin speaking.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>The woman in front of me held her sword with Yasmin's
strength, but none of Yasmin's skill.  I couldn't tell if she was
even making an effort to guard herself; certainly, it would have
been laughably easy to knock the blade aside and run her through.
Just one small problem...
</p><p align=left>"Yes," Rivi laughed with Yasmin's mouth, "you must be torn,
poor man.  On one hand, I'm sure you could kill this lovely body
without a speck of trouble.  On the other, I've detected a wee
fondness, shall we say, between you and this woman.  Can you
really kill her to get me?  Especially when you have no idea
whether killing her will hurt me at all."
</p><p align=left>"If you've switched bodies with Yasmin--"
</p><p align=left>"But that's the question, isn't it?" Rivi interrupted.  "Is
Yasmin's wee soul safe and sound in my own body...a simple swap?
Or is Yasmin still inside this body, but dominated by my vastly
superior willpower?"
</p><p align=left>"In a contest of willpower between you and Yasmin," I said,
"I'd put my gold on Yasmin any day."
</p><p align=left>"Loyalty!" she chuckled, clapping her hands with delight.
"How quaint.  And perhaps, darling, the contest between me and
Yasmin might have been a wee bit fiercer another time, another
place.  However, for one enchanted second, your dear-heart
completely let down her guard--no doubt staring into your strong
manly eyes.  She opened herself so wide...well, I just couldn't
resist slithering in.  And now that I'm inside, only another
psionic could possibly throw me out again."
</p><p align=left>She simpered, as if she expected praise for being so clever.
I marveled at just how repugnant I could find the face that I
loved; at how the same flesh and bone could be so transformed by
the spirit within.  Then again, a painter's eye is keenly attuned
to such subtleties--a tiny stroke of the brush can change a
portrait's features from stern composure to pompous buffoonery.
I'd played such tricks many times on canvas; I just never
expected to see the effect in real life.
</p><p align=left>"All right," I said, "have fun in Yasmin's body.  I'm going to
find your real carcass."  Stepping around her, I strode off down
the corridor, heading for the room where Wheezle and I had found
Rivi's belongings on our first visit to the Spider.  Perhaps
Rivi's body wouldn't be there, but it was the natural place to
start looking.
</p><p align=left>Rivi/Yasmin loosed an indignant squeal and scurried to follow
on my heels.  "You can't just ignore me!" she cried.  "I'm in
your lover's body!"
</p><p align=left>"So?"
</p><p align=left>"So you should...you should..."  Her voice trailed off.
</p><p align=left>"I should moan and groan that Yasmin's possessed?  Beg you to
let her go?  Pike that, Rivi," I laughed, "the best way to handle
brats is to ignore them."
</p><p align=left>And I ran down the hall, leaving Rivi to fume.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Let me say for the record that I was not so blas as I wanted
Rivi to believe--seeing the nasty wee albino inside Yasmin's body
gave me cold chills.  If Rivi wanted, she could use Yasmin's own
sword to start carving up her body, flesh wounds just to horrify
me or a good slash to the throat to end it all.  One reason I ran
was to get away before such ideas occurred to Rivi's foul mind;
she wouldn't hurt Yasmin unless I was there to watch.  Besides,
Rivi might not be able to damage Yasmin without dislodging
herself: the pain of injury might break Rivi's concentration,
sending her back to her own body.  I didn't know if psionics
truly worked like that, but I prayed to The Lady it was so.
</p><p align=left>In less than a minute, I had reached the machine room where
Wheezle and I found the clay tablets.  Unlike the room where we'd
fought the Fox, this place still had its engines intact: pistons
clanging, steam hissing, belts slapping through pulleys and
gears.  In the corner of the main room, the walls of the control
bunker had turned transparent...a disconcerting effect, even if
I'd seen it before.  Rivi's body lay comfortably on a cot inside
the room, her eyes closed, her hands folded, her chest rising and
falling with tranquil breaths.  The grinders, white and brown,
stood atop large glass jars beside the cot; dust trickled out of
each grinder like sand through an hourglass, so that the jars
were now half full.
</p><p align=left>This looks easy, I thought to myself: just walk in, put my
rapier to Rivi's throat, and threaten to carve her like mutton
unless she lets go of Yasmin's mind.  But why waste breath on
threats?  Why not try a gash or two, non-lethal cuts to see if
the pain made it impossible for Rivi to keep Yasmin under
control?  I strode toward the door, ready to wreak violence on
the albino body...
</p><p align=left>...and the sodding door was locked.
</p><p align=left>The body on the cot stirred, opened her eyes, and smirked as
she sat up.  "Troubles, darling?"
</p><p align=left>"Just a minor setback," I replied.  "If I can't get in, you
can't get out.  How long does it take to die of thirst, Rivi?"
</p><p align=left>"More time than you've got, Britlin dear.  I've given back
Yasmin her precious wee mind...with one tiny alteration."
</p><p align=left>I shuddered.  "What did you do?"
</p><p align=left>"A simple illusion--when she sees you, she'll think she's
looking at me."
</p><p align=left>Behind my back, Yasmin roared, "Rivi, prepare to die!"

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Yasmin had a longsword, I had a rapier.  Her weapon gave her
the edge in strength, mine the edge in speed.  In terms of skill,
I thought we might be evenly matched, but in terms of
motivation...she burned with a killer's fury, while I was sick at
heart.
</p><p align=left>Her first charge was pure rage, no feints, no tricks, no
strategy--just a lightning lunge that would have gutted me if I
hadn't knocked it aside and backed off fast.  I would have gone
for Rivi the same way: swift and lethal, trying to put her down
before she could use her mental witchery.  Yasmin followed up
with more brute strength, slashes, thrusts, hammering at my
guard, urgently pressing to end this quickly.  I parried, dodged,
blocked, and sideslipped, until I finally saw a momentary opening
and drove a kick into her stomach.  She staggered back a foot,
then retreated further to a point where she could study me
warily.
</p><p align=left>"You're better than I expected," she said.  "Maybe because
you're using Britlin's sword.  What did you do to him?"
</p><p align=left>"I am Britlin," I replied.  "Can't you tell?"
</p><p align=left>"Sorry, darling," called Rivi, lounging on her cot, "she won't
understand a word you're saying.  All she hears is gibberish."
</p><p align=left>I cursed and pointed toward the control room.  If Yasmin
couldn't understand what I said, at least she could follow my
finger.  "Look!" I told her, "there's the real Rivi!"
</p><p align=left>"Sorry again," Rivi laughed, "but her wee brain can only see
one of me.  I'm afraid that one is you."
</p><p align=left>"If you've hurt Britlin," Yasmin stared venomously at me,
"I'll run you through--"
</p><p align=left>She stabbed forward in the middle of her sentence: an old
trick, aimed at skewering your opponent while he's waiting for
you to finish the phrase.  I parried, ducked under a moving
machine-belt, and blocked another thrust mere inches from my
groin.
</p><p align=left>The next two minutes were hell: Yasmin attacked me with
everything she'd got, and I could only defend.  Such a fight goes
against all a swordsman's training--you always follow blocks with
attacks, because more than half of defense is your opponent's
fear of offense.  If Yasmin ever realized I wouldn't strike back,
she could take enormous advantage of the situation...throw
caution to the winds, commit to extravagant all-or-nothing
thrusts, leave herself wide open as she tried to take me down.
I'm sure she considered such tactics after our first few
exchanges, for she must have noticed I was reining myself in.
Still, she may have thought my lack of aggression was a trick on
Rivi's part, some ruse to lull her into a mistake; and to be
honest, I couldn't completely restrict myself to defensive
maneuvers.  Sometimes, when I saw an opening, when her blade
moved an instant too slowly or she had to duck a rocker arm that
clicked past her head, my fencing reflexes took over and I
attacked in spite of myself.  Thank The Lady, I always stopped
short of a death thrust...although most of the time, it was
Yasmin who stopped the blow, not I.
</p><p align=left>Don't get the idea that we dueled for so long without landing
any touches.  Yasmin caught me a dozen times, and despite my
intentions, I pinked her back just as often.  Our salvation was
the uncanny white cloth the nagas had produced for us: Yasmin's
outfit shaped like her original dragonskin sheath, covering her
body from toe to throat; and my outfit tailored into normal
jacket, shirt and pants, but still protecting everything but my
hands and head.  The cloth had an uncanny ability to turn
straight thrusts into glancing blows, to resist slashes and
soften the force of even the most vicious chops.  True, the
clothes were not totally impervious to steel (as I found when
Yasmin's blade tore a gash in my left forearm), but they saved me
on several occasions when skill and guile could not.
</p><p align=left>And so we fought amidst the machines, clambering over cogs,
scalded by spurts of steam, playing cat-and-mouse around the
slamming pistons.  Rivi sat in her control room, mocking and
jeering in the hope of goading me to a moment's inattention.  I
ignored her taunts and spoke only to Yasmin: "It's me, it's
Britlin, can't you tell?"  She couldn't be fooled forever, could
she?  Rivi's illusion would have to falter eventually; or Yasmin
might figure it out on her own.  Yasmin knew well enough that
Rivi could play tricks on her mind, and if she thought everything
through--how reluctantly I was fighting, how my clothes had the
same unnatural protective quality as hers, how my words turned
into babble as they came from my mouth...
</p><p align=left>Yes, in the long run, Yasmin would figure it out.  The only
question was whether she'd kill me first.
</p><p align=left>A furious gout of steam sprayed from a release-cock off to my
right, blasting a mist of condensation over a large pressure dial
on the side of a boiler.  The dial's face was glass, and almost
three feet in diameter--made big, I suppose, so even a short-
sighted operator could see if the gauge hit the red.  The fogged-
over glass gave me an idea...an idea that almost killed me, as
Yasmin took advantage of my momentary distraction to make a
vicious hack at my throat.  I dodged back by the narrowest of
margins, so close her blade trimmed my beard; then I spurred
myself into a flurry of offense, driving her back almost ten
yards until I forced her to duck behind a camshaft for
protection.
</p><p align=left>She braced herself, expected me to press the attack.  I
didn't; now that she was safely out of the way, I ran back to the
steamed-up dial and wrote with my finger, I'M BRITLIN.
</p><p align=left>The letters were abysmally blurred, partly because I was
writing as fast as a panicked rabbit, partly because condensation
is not well-suited for calligraphy; but I squinched out my
message in dripping script, then stood back, waiting for Yasmin
to look at it.  She came forward cautiously, fearful of
tricks...and even after she'd read the words, I could see she was
far from convinced: this was just the sort of deception Rivi
might use to hoodwink a gullible enemy.  Yasmin didn't lower her
sword, and the look in her eye said she might start the fight
again any second.  For the moment, however, she wasn't trying to
put me in the dead-book.  That was all I could hope for.
</p><p align=left>The real Rivi, still on her cot at the rear of the control
room, couldn't quite see the fogged-over dial from where she was
sitting.  Now she stood up and came forward to the spot where the
controller would normally sit, a place with a clear line of sight
to the gauge.  Her jaw dropped, her eyes widened, and she split
the air with a screech of rage, so intense I swear I could feel
it as tangible heat scorching the air.  Yasmin gave a start, then
turned her eyes in the direction of the scream.  Her grip
tightened on the butt of her sword, and she took a single step
toward the control room.
</p><p align=left>"My, my," I said to Yasmin, "looks like Rivi just fumbled her
hold on you."
</p><p align=left>"Hush," Yasmin growled.  "I'm fantasizing how lovely it will
look to see fresh red blood on that scrawny white skin.  A nice
gingham effect."
</p><p align=left>"Unfortunately, the control room door is locked."
</p><p align=left>"I'll chew it open."
</p><p align=left>"Don't--I like your smile."  Patting her on the shoulder, I
whispered, "We have a way past locked doors as soon as he wakes
up."
</p><p align=left>"And what will Rivi do to us in the meantime?" Yasmin
demanded.  "Make us kill each other?  Make us into her slaves?
We can't afford to wait for Hezekiah..."  She stopped for a
second, then continued.  "...to come and save us from this mind-
raping slag who just gloats inside that unbreachable control
room..."
</p><p align=left>Yasmin's voice grew louder with every word, but I wasn't
listening to what she was saying, anymore than she was listening
herself.  She was simply talking, ranting to hold Rivi's
attention; because in the moment that Yasmin had fallen silent,
Hezekiah, Irene, and Miriam had materialized inside the control
room, appearing silently behind Rivi's back.  Yasmin had
recovered her surprise quickly enough to continue her
tirade...and in mere seconds, I expected big-knuckled Miriam to
punch Rivi's face through a control panel.
</p><p align=left>I should have known better.
</p><p align=left>Miriam stepped forward stealthily, fists coming up to the
ready; but Hezekiah, Clueless boy, had somehow talked Miriam into
giving him the firewand she'd acquired at the Vertical Sea.  He
aimed it at Rivi now, and shouted, "Surrender or I'll shoot!"
</p><p align=left>Despite the rumble of machinery all around us, I could
distinctly hear the sound of everyone cringing.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>Miriam leapt forward anyway, hoping to scrag Rivi before the
nasty wee albino had a chance to react.  Unfortunately, Rivi's
tantrum had run its course, and she was ready to cause more
trouble.  Before Miriam could land the first punch, Rivi lashed
out a blast of psychic force so powerful it rippled the air.  The
bolt struck Miriam square in the face, so hard it knocked her to
knees...but she got up again after a long count of three, moving
as stiffly as something undead.
</p><p align=left>I didn't like the blank expression she wore.
</p><p align=left>"Surrender!" Hezekiah cried again.  "I really mean it."
</p><p align=left>Rivi laughed at him.  "You're going to shoot me with a
fireball, are you?  In this tiny wee room?  Do you know the
damage fireballs make in such a confined space?  You'd be fried
to a crisp yourself."
</p><p align=left>"Maybe I wouldn't mind frying to a crisp if I took you with
me."  Keeping the wand trained on Rivi, the boy crouched beside
the cot and tucked the grinders into his pockets.  "Maybe I
should just grab you and teleport you out where there's no air."
</p><p align=left>"What a brave wee you!" Rivi jeered.  "And in time, you might
actually find the courage to do it.  Pity you won't have the
chance."
</p><p align=left>She snapped her fingers and Miriam surged forward.  Hezekiah
could only stare in horror as the woman of his affections knocked
the firewand out of his hand and threw him back against the wall.
A moment later, she had pinioned his arms at the wrists, holding
him as solid as granite despite his struggles to break free.
</p><p align=left>"You're such a trusting wee soul," Rivi told the boy.  "Miriam
worked for me, you knew that.  Do you think I'd put her on the
payroll without a handle on her?  Oh yes, her mind is almost
entirely her own--it's a bore to make someone your abject slave,
and it's tiring work too--but I left a wee seed of submission in
the deepest cranny of her brain, just in case I needed it.  Which
means I win again."
</p><p align=left>"No."
</p><p align=left>The word came from Irene.  She had picked up the firewand.
She aimed it at Rivi.
</p><p align=left>"And who's this new addition to your merry band?" Rivi asked.
"An wee orc maiden...how charming.  Orc maiden, do you realize
that I can crawl inside your mind and twist it around my finger?"
</p><p align=left>"You can't."  Irene took a step forward.
</p><p align=left>"You think I can't control two people at once?" Rivi said.
"You're quite...quite..."
</p><p align=left>Irene took another step forward.
</p><p align=left>"Stop!" Rivi shouted.
</p><p align=left>Hezekiah, still held tightly by Miriam, let loose a nasty
chuckle.  "You're in trouble, Rivi.  Uncle Toby says it's next to
impossible to control people who are insa--...whose minds work in
unusual ways.  Their delus--...I mean, their special thoughts are
like impenetrable labyrinths between you and their real selves."
</p><p align=left>"Your Uncle Toby's a berk," Rivi snapped.  "Just because this
old slag is barmy doesn't mean I can't..."
</p><p align=left>Irene took another step toward the albino.  "My prince wants
you to surrender.  Surrender!"
</p><p align=left>"You can't fire that wand," Rivi snarled.  "You don't know the
invocation."
</p><p align=left>"I heard Miriam say the words," Irene replied.  "Back at the
Vertical Sea.  Surrender to my prince!"
</p><p align=left>"Never!"
</p><p align=left>I would have sworn Rivi couldn't conceal so much as a
toothpick inside that sheer black gown of hers; but she crossed
her arms so that each hand could reach into the opposite sleeve,
and a second later, out popped two more firewands--twins to the
one Irene held.
</p><p align=left>"How many of those sodding things did the Fox make?" Yasmin
groaned; but Rivi was already fixing Irene with a look of
sneering superiority.
</p><p align=left>"See these?" Rivi gloated.  "See what I've got, you addle-
coved wee barmy?  I've got you outnumbered, that's what I've got.
Outflanked and out-firepowered, follow me, darling?  Even your
pathetic excuse for a brain should see you're beaten."
</p><p align=left>"You will not surrender?" Irene said quietly.
</p><p align=left>"Why should I?" Rivi asked.  "You're a loser, just like the
rest of your pathetic wee band.  You surrender to me!"
</p><p align=left>The wand in Irene's hand aimed straight at Rivi's heart.  The
old orc opened her mouth.  "In nomine--"
</p><p align=left>"Uh-oh," said Hezekiah.
</p><p align=left>"Irene, don't!" said I.
</p><p align=left>"Down!" said Yasmin...but I was already throwing myself onto
the floor.
</p><p align=left>"--Vulpes," Irene finished.
</p><p align=left>Not just one fireball.  Three of them.  From three firewands.
Irene's and Rivi's, all triggered by the same invocation.  All
going off simultaneously in a single small room.
</p><p align=left>A moment before, the control room walls had been as
transparent as glass.  Now with a triple flash of fire, the
interior was splash-blasted black: as black as a coat of paint,
except that this blackness came from the incinerated remains of
everything inside.  All the people, all the control panels, even
the air itself had been baked in an instant, vaporized to opaque
black char.
</p><p align=left>Then came the sound of the explosion: an almost delicate
CRUMP, as if the inferno was so sure of itself it didn't need to
make noise.  The walls of the room gave a tiny shiver, but that
was all--whatever the room was made of, it was strong enough to
stand a volcano.
</p><p align=left>Slowly, Yasmin and I stood up.  The blackened hulk of the
control room gave off heat like a cast-iron stove; touch a paper
to it, and the page would burst into flames.  No mere human could
approach those sizzling walls without roasting his skin.
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah!" I called.  "You teleported away in time, didn't
you?  Hezekiah?"
</p><p align=left>No answer.
</p><p align=left>Yasmin turned a slow circle, eyes scanning the machine room
around us.  I did the same--no sign of the boy.
</p><p align=left>"Maybe he teleported to another part of the Spider," Yasmin
said in a low voice.
</p><p align=left>"I hope so," I replied.  "If he panicked and ended up out in
the dust, he's dead.  Hezekiah?"
</p><p align=left>My only answer was a sharp hiss of steam: a protracted hiss
that sent a cloud of vapor roiling into the air.
</p><p align=left>"I just had a nasty thought," Yasmin murmured.  "All these
machines must be controlled from inside that room, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Right."
</p><p align=left>"And I'll bet there's not much left of the control panels in
there."
</p><p align=left>I stared at the charred walls, still radiating a blistering
temperature.  "No argument," I told her.  "We'd better get out of
here."
</p><p align=left>"What about the others?"
</p><p align=left>"Hezekiah was touching Miriam.  If he managed to get away, he
took her with him.  They'll know enough to head for the gate to
Mount Celestia.  As for Irene and Rivi...they're gone."
</p><p align=left>"Are you sure?" Yasmin asked.
</p><p align=left>I lifted my hand to feel the heat from the control room walls.
"No chance of going inside to check for bodies.  You won't find
bodies anyway--just albino cinders."  In the rear of the room, a
cog suddenly gave a loud clank, followed by a hideous grinding
sound.  "Come on," I said, holding out my hand.  "We have to go."

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>By the time we reached the upper floor, it was obvious the
Spider was sinking into the dust again--not a precipitous dive
like the last time, but a slow swiveling descent like a screw
twisting into a board.  Some of the legs were walking; some of
the legs had stopped.  And so the Spider rotated gradually
downward into the infinite sea of Dust.
</p><p align=left>"It's beautiful, isn't it?" Yasmin said, staring out the
window at the endless gray expanse.
</p><p align=left>"It's stark," I replied.  "I suppose to a Handmaid of Entropy,
that's the same thing as beautiful."
</p><p align=left>"Sometimes," she nodded.
</p><p align=left>In silence, I contemplated her face.  In silence, she
contemplated the ultimate desert.  I thought of how fondly she'd
talked about the Plane of Dust back in Carceri; so it didn't come
as a surprise when she murmured, "I'm not going with you to Mount
Celestia."
</p><p align=left>"You're staying here?"
</p><p align=left>"For a while," she nodded.  "When I look out and see all that
peace..."  She tilted her head toward the dust.  "I need this,
Britlin.  Just for a time.  It's not your fault, but I need to
let things sink in...see what I can put behind me."
</p><p align=left>"Are you sure you can survive out there?"
</p><p align=left>"I have the spells I need," she answered.  "Besides, this
plane is my spiritual home.  It will sustain me."  She pressed
one palm to the glass, then slowly let it slide downward.
"Somewhere out there," she said, "the Doomguard have a
stronghold: the Citadel Alluvius.  It's very quiet, very
peaceful.  I healed there once before."
</p><p align=left>"There's no real proof you're my sister," I told her.
</p><p align=left>She smiled and turned my way.  "Trying to kick me out of the
family?"
</p><p align=left>I shook my head.
</p><p align=left>Laying a cool hand on my cheek, she leaned in very close and
whispered, "If you come across proof, one way or the other, come
find me."
</p><p align=left>"Find you here?"
</p><p align=left>"Or someplace else.  It's really quite a small multiverse."
</p><p align=left>She let her hand linger on my face a moment longer, then
turned away.  With one last look out the window, Yasmin smiled
and began walking down the nearest arm of the Spider.  When I
moved to follow her, she gestured for me to stop.  "I have to go
alone, Britlin.  I can survive out there, but you can't."
</p><p align=left>"You think you can walk where you're going?  This plane is
infinite--the Citadel could be millions of miles away."
</p><p align=left>"This plane is the chalice of my soul," she said.  "When my
soul has walked for long enough, the Citadel will come into
sight."
</p><p align=left>"And if I walk long enough, will you come into sight again?"
</p><p align=left>She made no answer.
</p><p align=left>I stayed by the window.  In time, I saw her white-clad figure
slip into view, walking lightly on the dust.  She left no
footprints.
</p><p align=left>Slowly, the Spider continued to rotate, notching its way ever
downward.  Yasmin disappeared from sight; and when the Spider had
come around once more to the same angle, my sister was gone.

<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
</p><p align=left>"What'cha looking at?" said a nasal voice behind my shoulder.
</p><p align=left>I let my head thump forward against the window pane.  It felt
so good, I banged it again.  "Hezekiah," I grimaced, "I'm coming
to believe that nothing in the multiverse can kill you."
</p><p align=left>"Shows how Clueless you are," the boy said.  "Uncle Toby will
slice me for sure if he hears I have a price on my head.  How
long have I been away from home?  Two weeks?"
</p><p align=left>I turned to face him.  Miriam was there too, her arm clasped
tightly around his waist.  Both of them wore grins that managed
to be smug and sheepish at the same time.  "What have you two
been up to?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>"Nothing," Hezekiah answered defensively.  "I teleported away
from Rivi in the nick of time, and a second later, Miriam's mind
snapped back to normal.  She was grateful to be free."
</p><p align=left>"Grateful," I repeated.
</p><p align=left>"Can't a woman be grateful?" Miriam demanded.
</p><p align=left>"You might have told us you were all right."
</p><p align=left>"There was no hurry," Hezekiah replied.  "Rivi was totally
incinerated, right?  You two were outside the room, so you were
okay.  And Miriam was grateful."
</p><p align=left>"Yes, I believe we've established Miriam's state of mind," I
muttered.  "Do you still have the grinders?"
</p><p align=left>"Nah, I teleported them outside.  High time they got lost in
the dust again, right?"
</p><p align=left>"Best place for them," I nodded.
</p><p align=left>"That's what I said," Miriam put in.  "Sod the piking
grinders."
</p><p align=left>"Anyway," Hezekiah went on, "I was glad to get rid of the
grinders but I was feeling pretty lowdown about Irene-- and Oonah
and Wheezle and everyone else--and Miriam said, Kid, you could
use some cheering up..."
</p><p align=left>The boy continued to babble all the way to Mount Celestia.

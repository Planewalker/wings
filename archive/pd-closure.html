The dark elf perched, half listening to the heated debate taking place some metres 
away. Some things never change, he mused. How many times had he observed, or 
taken place in, a scene very like this one, in the past? True, those arguments had 
been with other drow, not Baatezu, but it was basically the same thing. And then, 
like now, he was none too fond of the people he shared with room with. Still, he 
could tolerate, even admire, the hell-dwellers, in ways which he could never tolerate, or
admire, his fellow drow. The Baatezu believed in order, strove their 
whole lives for it, ruled their existence with it. It was certainly far 
more admirable than the barely controlled chaos of the drow. 
</p><p align=left>
At this time, however, it hardly mattered. He was here for a higher 
purpose.  Subtle stealth and superb skill had gained his entrance to this 
Baator Castle, and now, he gazed upon his quarry.
</p><p align=left>
The Baatorian courtier was playing a game of conversational
one-upsmanship that was common to thousands of courts in thousands of realms.
Save for the fact that most of those beings, in most of those courts, were
not ten feet tall, eight hundred pounds, and sporting black bat wings. 
A few minutes later, the devil excused himself from his "sparring partner,"
walking away, apparently having had enough for the moment. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow smiled ever so slightly, waiting a few moments before moving 
himself, letting his own form become lost in the flow of bodies about him. 
The hallways curved into a round hollow, a chamber between destinations. 
The courtier passed along the edge, blending in, himself. The drow followed 
from the other side of the room, several paces ahead, keeping the devil in view, 
utilizing elven eyes to best advantage.  Soon, they had arrived at the corridors 
containing private suites. The hallway the courtier entered was empty.
The drow materialized beside the Baatazu, drawing a razor sharp sword, 
moving so fast that the devil barely saw what was coming. Arms came out the crush 
the attacker, to bat him away, but the devil was far too slow. The sword sheathed itself in 
the Baatazu's heart.  Quickly, the drow danced out of the path of the falling corpse. 
A thud sounded as it hit the ground.

The drow was gone, far from the Castle, when the body was found.

The room was empty, silent, already piling up with dust. Soon, someone 
would come in, acquire the space, and the previous inhabitant would
be all but forgotten. 
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein smiled slightly. He would remember. He would remember the 
slight, clever tiefling that had befriended him those centuries ago, 
back in Menzoberranzan, working past his barriers with all the ease
of one butting their head on a brick wall, attempting to smash through.
It had not been easy for the mage, and Zaknafein still did
not know why the tiefling had tried so hard. But, he had finally 
succeeded, gaining a true friend for them both. 
</p><p align=left>
Just a few days ago now, the Baatezu courtier, visiting the tiefling Grew's
mage shop in Sigil, had become angry, and even the normally clever and 
unbreachable tiefling had not been able to hold off this time.  Grew's luck had run out. 
</p><p align=left>
When Zaknafein had found out of his friend's death, the Baatezu courtier's
luck had run out, as well. He had taken revenge for his friend. 
It changed nothing, but it satisfied Zaknafein's need for action, for closure.
</p><p align=left>
With a slight shake of his head, the dark elven warrior walked out the door.
He did not look back.

Water. I am lying water. These were the first thoughts to seep in to Jared's
conscious mind. Other thoughts soon came flooding in and they threatened to
drown small flame of wakefulness that was growing n his mind. It's cold.
Lying in water. Rhythmic banging sound. Wood being struck by metal.
Hammering. Yes, hammering. It's also cold. The water that I am lying in is
cold. Suddenly the flame of wakefulness roared in to life and Jared's
muscles immediately responded. Within a few moments he was up and moving 
towards the sound of the banging before his mind could fully make sense of
his body's actions. The sudden rush of blood to Jared's head made him feel
light headed, like an empty flask resonating in tune with the banging coming
from further up the passage. The water sloshed around his numb legs that 
barely managed to keep him upright and moving. After what seemed like an 
eternity Jared turned the corner in the partially submerged sewer and came
face to face with the charge that he had been hired to guard and then later
rescue. The scene in the chamber made him question whether he was not still
dreaming. But after several long moments Jared realized that he was indeed
standing in a chamber occupied by the small scholar working on several
pieces of a strangely shaped boat and not in some twisted dream.

The nightmares had returned and had brought back with them terrible
torments. Sounds of battle accompanied by shouts of pain and cries of anger.
The man thrashed and twisted amidst the rags that he slept in, his body
responding to a world that existed only in the dark regions of his dreams.
Two combatants fought each other with spell and sword. Both were creatures
surrounded by light, but one contained an inner light that was dark and
corrupt. Whilst the other's light was pure both within and without. As ever
in the man's dreams the angel of light beseeched her former companion to 
turn from the dark path. Laughing in scorn and derision the dark angel
struck and wounded his foe. Despite the wounded angel's efforts to protect
herself from her opponent he proved to be stronger and quicker. The dreamer
howled with impotent rage at his inability to prevent the inevitable end of
the nightmare from approaching. Just then the former knight and thrashing
dreamer woke from his wine induced nightmare to find that it had become
reality.

The harmonium officer glanced around him in a stern gaze, hoping that his
men would not see the fear reflected in his eyes. The mob that they were 
facing was fierce indeed as it included several Xaositecs and Anarchists.
Several weapons had been thrown at his men causing a few minor injuries. The
Harmonium officer signaled for his men to lift their large shields and 
batons and prepare for a charge to break up the mob. In response to this the
mob quieted down and drew closer together. At first it seemed as if they 
were content to stand motionless, but then they began softly chant
repeatedly. The chant was quickly taken up by each of the members of the mob
both young and old, man and woman. "Legend?.. Legend?. LEGEND." The
Harmonium officer immediately recognized this behavior from similar
incidents in the past few days and sharply blew his whistle. Despite the 
strange occurrences around them, the patrol acted as one body surging
forward in to the mob. The chanting was broken off abruptly, being replaced
by grunts, shouts and cries. The Harmonium patrol hit the mob like a wave
and broke through their ranks without meeting any resistance. Men and women
scattered leaving the patrolmen to collect themselves, checking for further
injuries. The Harmonium officer glanced around the now deserted street. He
was struck by how the peace and quiet reminded him of a certain abandoned
park. But he quickly dismissed such idle thoughts and focused on the task of
arresting the members of this new and dangerous cult.

The spy dared not open his eyes for fear of what he might see. The door to
the tavern had opened and several more figures had filed in and taken seats
at one of the few empty tables left. He had caught a glimpse of the figures
when the door opened, but had then quickly shut his eyes. A faint whimper
escaped his lips and the spy instinctively opened his eyes to see if anyone
had noticed. As he quickly scanned the room his eyes came to rest on the 
newcomers. The spy coughed several times, unable to control the fear that
was eliciting this response. After a several minutes the spy was able to 
recover himself and address the issue of who and what the newcomers were.
Forcing himself to look in their direction he studied them for a few
moments. They were Hydroloths. A race of frog shaped Yugoloth that were
called Hydroloths! His jaw fell open and he let out a silent scream. As he
did so the Hydroloths turned and looked directly at him.

I am joined to my neighbor. My neighbor is joined to me. Together we form
a greater whole. But we are not complete. We, that is I, am missing 
something. This incompleteness is not a natural state. Another neighbor is
added to my neighbor. Soon we shall be whole and complete. Very soon.

In a dark region of a vast and silent swamp, the surface of the water
rippled for the first time in centuries. The ripples spread out swiftly, 
heralding a growing change and the birth of a new order.

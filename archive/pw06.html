Why am I here? I am far and away more useful for other missions. Here I
am, son of a royal duke on the elemental plane of air, out on the waste of a
plane, looking for someone that the Great Unknown told factol Ambar to find a
great resource out here. Why would a good cutter find themselves on a hideous
plane like the Gray Waste. Someday I will evolve to "god hood", but I guess if
I could follow in a group that will help lead me down the path to
enlightenment, it would aid others down that road. Mortals seem to be just as
capable for god hood, but they just don't realize it. They just want to life
fast and die young without realizing that they could be immortal. This Godsmen
are wise, but they count themselves lucky to have me as a member.</p><p align=left>

I am far too close to the Arawn's palace. He is a mild power for a god of the
dead, but he doesn't like berks coming too close. Besides hearing the moans of
these poor souls who didn't see the light is annoying as well as depressing.
The mortals don't know their potential that us plane touched see. I'll let them
know their potential. The Godsmen are a great faction, but the chances of me
finding a great resource  out on this plane is about the same chance of finding
a living fiend in Mount Celestia. Who's that up ahead? Could this be the thing
of which I am looking for? Oh no! It's another Gensai! Is this some kind of
joke? A water gensai! Much like myself, she too was spawned from the elemental
planes, just the wrong plane. She is planetouched, so I'll try to keep a civil
tongue for that sea queen.</p><p align=left>

"Greetings fair cutter." I said to the Gensai. She has sea greenish hair and
blue eyes, very unappealing female. She doesn't have the bluish skin and blue
hair of a duchess of air, not many exist. She seems to be wearing some sort of
holy symbol, all gensai usually worship elemental gods, all these beings really
are bold cutters who evolved to a higher state, what I will achieve someday.
I'd swear that the symbol was of a small mask, which doesn't seem to be one of
the elemental gods I know. The sea queen looked at me with hatred, she was like
most Gensai, shorter than mortals, and she stood around five feet tall, and she
seemed to have daggers strapped to her sides. Maybe she has a second profession
like myself, I wield a sword and a spell book. A smart cutter needs to have all
sorts of skills on the planes. She seemed to be in the Free League, her sign
was tattooed on her green arms. Her greenish skin turned dark. She grabbed to
her side for her dagger and leapt at me. The dagger barely missed me. I pulled
out a long sword. My sword stopped her dagger, but she kept stabbing furiously,
and I couldn't cast any spells. She slashed me with the blade, and I suddenly
felt numb. My sword dropped from my hand. My body turned stiff. Paralysis
poison. She smirked at me. "Berk, did you think that I would make your death
quick and painless? My God Mask is more ruthless than that." Mask? That's not
possible, our kind are supposed to worship elemental gods but what I've seen of
her, she does look like a priestess of a thieving power. She moved the dagger
up to my neck, and my royal blood started to drool down the blade.</p><p align=left>

"What's going on here?" I hear a voice say behind me say. The Sea Queen answers
"Nothing of your concern sweet thing. This rogue was trying to peel me, he is a
knight of the post." Oh by the Source, she should talk. "I don't know what a
knight of the post is, but I am not going to let you kill him, I sense no evil
from him, you however..." The Sea Queen screeched "You dare!" She jumped at
him. I couldn't see the combat. I did hear weapons clash, and heard the sea
bitch groan. Whoever he is, I don't think he was here to kill me. Seconds
later, a body dropped, and then it was quiet. Who won? A few minutes later, a
mortal walked in front of me. He looked like a blood warrior. A short mortal,
about five foot seven, with dark hair and green eyes. He was caked with blood,
not the Sea Queen's blood. He also is wearing chain mail, except it looked
stronger, more durable. These mortals are feeble to think they need armor to
protect themselves. He had a bastard sword strapped to his side, and his
crossbow was hanging on his left side. He must have been a sharp cutter to
defeat the sea-bitch. "I hope you are all right, I don't know what kind of
poison she used, so I don't know how long you will be paralyzed." I didn't know
either. The warrior looked rather gross, but I imagine there is very little
water on the Waste to take a bath. "Don't worry, I'll stay here until you can
move. Then perhaps we can talk." I wanted to agree with him, but my lips could
not move. He did save my life, so he did at least merit a conversation, if not
more.</p><p align=left>

The Blood warrior spoke to the Sea-witch. "So are you ready to talk now?" The
female's voice seethed out "You bastard! What are you doing with me, I'll bring
the wrath of Mask down on murrrphh..." I heard the warrior let out a heavy
sigh. He came into my view again and said "I hope you are more communicative."
The warrior made a camp, and started cooking some meat that looked like
Arbrian. Most mortals like meat, I am above such needs to kill animals to eat.
How barbaric! Hmm...it did smell good. Come to think of it, I am hungry. My
provisions are low walking on the Gray Waste for days to find this source.
Tingles moved through my body, the numbness fled me body. I tried to say my
name to the warrior. "Ahhcccccoon" That didn't come out right. The warrior
turned to me "What did you say?" My body tried to move but still can't tell if
I was moving. "Easy, the poison is wearing off, it's not like telling me what
you have to say is life or death. You'll be able to talk in a few minutes." </p><p align=left>

The tingling in my body got painful, it felt like it was blades slashing
through me.  The gray ground started to fall towards me. "Woah, woah, woah." I
could barely feel him catch me. My lips are finally able to speak. "Akon, I am
Akon, Wind Duke." A smirk came to Bane's lips. "A wind duke huh, some sort of
royalty?" Hmmm this warrior doesn't know the dark about Gensai, but he may have
spent his life fighting the Blood War, most Gensai have the intelligence to
stay away from the lower planes. "No good cutter, my father was a Genie, and I
am his heir. Are you some sort of Blood Warrior who got lost after the battle?"
The warrior shook his head. "No, I was the leader of the mortal forces, we won
the battle, and I got away. Tried to free myself from the chains of the
Baatezu, I haven't been too successful thus far. My name is Bane by the way."</p><p align=left>

The water bitch was tied up with a gag over her mouth. He noticed me looking at
her. "Oh yes, she seemed intent on killing you, what was your dispute?"  I
replied "Well, most Gensai have a general jealousy for each other, but this one
worships the god of the thieves, a real evil cutter. She immediately tried to
kill me, and stabbed me. Her intent was to torture me and put me in the dead
book, if it wasn't for you. I would have been writhing this ugly plane as a
larvae. Why did you escape from the Baatezu, you suddenly get a change of heart
over evil?" The blood warrior scowled "I was found on the Gray Waste by the
Baatezu with no memory of what happened to me. I still don't. At first I
thought I died, and was sent to hell, I'm still wondering if that isn't the
case." He's been on this plane too long. "I think you are alive Cutter. Maybe
you fell in the river Styx and lost your memory." The warrior replies "I
suppose that is possible, and I guess that means I may never get my memory
back." Bane's face grew dim. The more I talked to him, the more I thought he
was someone who could join our ranks. "I should take you back to Sigil." The
cutter replied "What's the point, I can't remember anything." He's definitely
been here too long!  "Bane, it's the way of the plane, it's making you bleak.
Come back with me and you will see Sigil, maybe we can find a way to restore
your memory." The bloody warrior looked at me and replied "Is there a place to
get cleaned up there?" A smile crosses my face, my faction would be pleased.</p><p align=left>

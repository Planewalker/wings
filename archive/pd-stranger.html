The ranger had finished setting up camp for the night, and now he simply sat upon the log in the clearing, 
regarding the crackling fire before him with a contemplative, purple shaded, almond shaped, gaze. He was 
not seeing in infra vision, the heat of the fire would have been too painful for that, upon his sensitive dark 
elven eyes, eyes that had been created to see within layers upon layers of darkness.  Instead, he simply 
allowed the night colours and the firelight to reign his sight for this night, in this clearing.
</p><p align=left>
He was travelling, currently, though of late his home was the tundra plains of Icewind Dale. It had been 
two years since the war between Ten Towns and the Barbarians had ended, and Drizzt Do'Urden had been 
feeling restless. And so, he had travelled. At first, just a bit, then more, then more.  Now, he was hundreds 
of miles away. He would go back, yes. His friends were there, his new friends of recent years, and he 
would not leave them for good, would not loose them, as he had lost others.
</p><p align=left>
One friend that had been with him over a span of more years than any other, the magical astral panther, 
Guenhwyvar, had been travelling with him all this day, and so the dark elf had released her back to her 
realm, to rest, and regain her strength. Thus, he sat alone, with the only the stars above for company. The 
stars, those twinkling pin points of mystical wonder, those that could capture the soul itself with but a 
glance.  Smiling slightly, wistfully, he shifted his gaze from the fire, up to those very stars, seen through 
the opening in the pine trees that made the clearing. 
</p><p align=left>
The stranger surprised him. A slender male form, cloaked and hooded in black, several inches taller than 
himself, and moving with a deadly feline grace. And impressive sight, all told, but it was that which had 
shocked him. It was the total silence and stealth with which he appeared in the clearing, with not a single 
warning to his approach. It was rare, very rare, for anything to take Drizzt by surprise, and this put him 
upon his guard at once.  Rising to his feet fluidly, his hands were tensed to draw weapons, when the 
stranger spoke. 
</p><p align=left>
"Would you care to share your camp?" the voice was deep, but muffled, a faintly melodious sound, with an 
accent rendered indeterminate by the hood. 
</p><p align=left>
Eyes narrowed in faint, remaining suspicion, Drizzt none the less nodded, and sat back down again as he 
said "If you wish."
</p><p align=left>
There was a faint chuckle, a sound that, strangely, put him at ease, "I would not have asked, if I did not 
wish."
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt could not help but smile in response, saying, "True. Have a seat," gesturing to the log beside his 
own seat.
 </p><p align=left>
The other moved gracefully to seat himself, and for a few moments there was nothing but the crackle of 
the fire. Drizzt thoughtfully studied the other traveller, noting the fact that even in the light, he kept the 
folds of his cloak close enough that not one feature of his face was revealed. He was wearing gloves as 
well, effectively masking his long, slender hands. 
</p><p align=left>
"Do I pass inspection?" the stranger inquired.
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt blinked, and said "I had not realised that I was being so obvious."
</p><p align=left>
"You weren't, but I can tell. You just need a little more practice."
</p><p align=left>
The dark elf's eyes widened slightly, and he nearly choked for a moment. "If the number of suspicious 
glances directed at me were practice, I'd be a master by now," he said finally.
</p><p align=left>
"Ah, but they aren't. You can't direct your work on someone else," there was a definite note of experience 
in that muffled voice.
</p><p align=left>
"What's your name?" Drizzt asked suddenly.
</p><p align=left>
There was an audible pause, seeming oddly intentional, and then the stranger replied, "Lennar."
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt smiled slightly, and extended his hand in cautious greeting, pleased suddenly with the turn of 
events. He himself was not cloaked, and it was rare, very rare, to find a stranger, or have one find you, as 
it were, who was not suspicious and violent towards a dark elf. It warmed Drizzt's melancholy mood to a 
more cheerful state. 
</p><p align=left>
"I'm Drizzt Do'Urden," he said, as he shook the other's hand firmly. The grasp was released, then, and 
both regarded the fire for a moment, before the one who called himself Lennar spoke again, "Where are 
you travelling to?"
</p><p align=left>
"Just...around. I was restless."
</p><p align=left>
"And you are from?"
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt glanced bemusedly over the his odd campfire guest. 
</p><p align=left>
"Icewind Dale, currently. I've been there for a few years."
</p><p align=left>
Lennar seemed to have no inclination to probe for an originating place, and asked then, in an curious 
voice, "Are you happy?"
</p><p align=left>
That seemed a strange question, Drizzt thought. He wondered suddenly what the person beneath that 
cloak looked like, and why he felt the need to conceal himself. But having felt that need before himself, he 
had not asked for the stranger to uncloak himself. Still, it was curious. And now this question. And. . .was 
he? Was he happy? Content at times, yes, but really, truly happy? He reviewed his recent years, thinking 
over new friends and hard won acceptance from some. A sudden burst of warmth filled him and he looked 
curiously at the stranger, as though he had just realised it for the first time, "Yes, yes I am happy," he 
wondered briefly what Lennar thought of his almost awed tone of voice. It had been a long time since he'd 
actually thought of, truly realised, his own happiness. 
</p><p align=left>
"Good," there was firm approval in that muffled voice, approval that suddenly made Drizzt glance at the 
other more closely. There was something about this person. . .but he didn't know what. 
</p><p align=left>
"What do you do?"
</p><p align=left>
"I'm a ranger."
</p><p align=left>
"But what do you do?"
</p><p align=left>
"I,. . .well, a lot of things. Different stuff. I do what I think is right."
</p><p align=left>
"And you will do anything to accomplish what you think right?"
</p><p align=left>
"Well, not anything. The ends don't justify the means, after all," Drizzt replied.
</p><p align=left>
"Mmm. And what are the right means?"
</p><p align=left>
"I. . ."
</p><p align=left>
Lennar shook his head as Drizzt trailed off into silence. What was the right thing?
</p><p align=left>
"It depends upon who you are, I suppose," Drizzt said finally.
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, it does. So, does that make anything right?"
</p><p align=left>
"Of course! Something has to be right."
</p><p align=left>
"Not really, considering that everything that does happen is right to one, and wrong to another. I 
understand that we all have our own standards, though," none the less, there seemed a note of something 
annoyed, or like, in that muffled voice.
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt opened his mouth to reply, and then closed it again. What would he say? He had already stated 
what he thought. Still, like the stranger, he suddenly found it unsatisfactory. 
</p><p align=left>
"Who are you?" Drizzt asked.
</p><p align=left>
"I am myself," Lennar answered.
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt eyed the other even more closely. What was it about this stranger that seemed so familiar? There 
was something, something about the attitude, the wry humour of that chuckle from earlier, the feline 
grace, the alternations in tone of voice. He knew this person. But, from where?
</p><p align=left>
"You seem so familiar!" he suddenly blurted out.
</p><p align=left>
 A low chuckle and a long pause emanated from Lennar, and then he said, "Really?"
</p><p align=left>
"Really," Drizzt said firmly, "Like I've met you before. I mean, the way you act, or. . .something. I can't 
quite place it. But I feel like I know you."
</p><p align=left>
"I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to have met you."
</p><p align=left>
"Why?"
</p><p align=left>
"You've done well," Lennar's voice seemed almost wistful., but approving.
</p><p align=left>
Drizzt had the definite feeling that Lennar was thinking on a level that Drizzt just was not on at that 
moment. He was using comparisons to something that Drizzt did not understand. The conversation was 
beginning to confuse him.
</p><p align=left>
"I suppose so. . ." Drizzt trailed off.
</p><p align=left>
Lennar nodded, and turned his attention back to the fire. Suddenly, he looked up, as though hearing 
something. 
</p><p align=left>
"I have to leave now. Thank you for letting me share your camp," he said.
</p><p align=left>
"You're leaving already?!" Drizzt exclaimed, wanting the stranger to stay further.
</p><p align=left>
"Yes. It was good to see you. Goodbye."
</p><p align=left>
Lennar extended his hand, and Drizzt shook is firmly, releasing his grip reluctantly as Lennar walked 
away, virtually melting into the shadows.  He wondered at Lennar's last comment, 'It was good to see you.' 
That did not seem the comment of a passing stranger.  Shaking his head, Drizzt went back to his fire. He 
did not sleep that night, but instead, contemplated the encounter.
</p><p align=left>

</p><p align=left>
A figure materialized outside the planar gate. The wizard looked up then, glancing over as his friend 
materialized. 
</p><p align=left>
"So, how did it go?"
</p><p align=left>
The cloaked one who had called himself Lennar flipped back his hood, and loosened his cloak, to reveal 
sharp, ebony skinned, dark elven features.  
</p><p align=left>
"It was. . .interesting," there was a studied neutrality to the drow's voice, as though fearing to reveal 
details. 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, that says a lot, Zak. You know you can be real stingy on details at times."
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein Do'Urden lifted an eyebrow wryly and said, "Who was this for, hmm? My piece of mind, or 
your entertainment?"
</p><p align=left>
"Well, it certainly wasn't for his piece of mind, considering you didn't even tell him who you are. Lennar, 
indeed. What the hell kind of name is that?"
</p><p align=left>
"One thought of on the spur of a moment. He has his own life, and doesn't need me around to screw it up."
</p><p align=left>
"Ya, and you act just like you always have. So, he probably thought there was something familiar about 
you, so he's going to be thinking about it for who knows how long, but because he thinks your dead, it 
won't occur to him and--"
</p><p align=left>
"I am dead," Zaknafein said, again wryly.
</p><p align=left>
"No, you're undead. There is a difference. Mainly, you still have memories, and aren't stuck as a petitioner 
in some hellhole of a plane."
</p><p align=left>
"By the way, how is it that you knew I didn't tell him?"
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, I just figured."
</p><p align=left>
"Yes. And what about the familiar feelings and such. I supposed you guessed that too, hmm?"
</p><p align=left>
The tiefling's eyes opened wide, and he said, "Well, I just assumed. . ."
</p><p align=left>
"You were eavesdropping," Zaknafein growled.
</p><p align=left>
"No! I wouldn't--"
</p><p align=left>
"Do such a thing? Now I know you were. You eavesdrop on many."
</p><p align=left>
"Well, I was just watching to see if there was a problem with the gate key and--"
</p><p align=left>
"Right. I'll be going now. Thank you for setting that up."
</p><p align=left>
"Hey, your're fine, eh?"
</p><p align=left>
"Oh yes," the dark elf said, with a sharp smile, "I'm fine."

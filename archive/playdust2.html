Gods be damned but didn't I swear to myself that I wouldn't fall too deeply
into sleep, that this was not the type of place to sleep deeply in, that I
would limit myself to cat naps!? A cutter can make mistakes, and maybe get
away with them, but I really made a leatherheaded move that time. Voices
disturbed my sleep, particularly Zaknafein's, as he snarled, "Wake that
useless woman up before I let them through to her!"
</p><p align=left>
A hand shook me urgently, angrily, hairy fingers on my arm. Not any of the
elves, then. Fretqw, it had to be. Hair on the inside of his hands?
Ooookay. In any case, I rolled over and jumped to my feet, rubbing a hand
across groggy, sleep full eyes. What I saw caused me to near fall on my face. 
</p><p align=left>
The Limbodians were back. Zaknafein was fighting the material ones with
both swords, dancing and whirling in lightening quick motions that damn
near awed me by their sheer speed. For the sake of the Lady, I've seen him
wave his whip around, and take the head off of the Limbo dwarf woman, but
this was different. This was full battle form, and after seeing that, I was
sure I never wanted to go against him in a fight. He'd already proven
himself clever by the manner in which he'd caught me the first time, but
this completed the portfolio, so to speak. 
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein and the Sorcery Master were in the far corner of the room,
chanting, gesturing with their hands, quickly and with studied
concentration. The Limbodians wavered every once a while, but it's takes a
bit to banish something without proper preparation, especially something as
powerful as these Limbo cutters were. Eventually, though, one of them
disappeared, fading slowly and reluctantly into thin air, and back into the
Planar circle. 
</p><p align=left>
My own weapons, multitudes of daggers hidden about my person, were really
no good against the creatures, so I didn't even bother. What I did do was
move over to where Freqtw was and hiss in his ear:
</p><p align=left>
"Do you know any portal spells? To anywhere, preferably some place
completely orderly?"
</p><p align=left>
Fretqw suddenly grinned, "I have one to Mechanus."
</p><p align=left>
"Great. They'll love that. I retain one talent from my High Ogre ancestors,
Freqtw," I said dryly, "And that's a siren song of sorts. It doesn't make
people fall under my charms, but it does attract their attention. If you
can open that gate, I can perhaps lure them close enough so that the others
can get them in it."
</p><p align=left>
"Sounds great, mercenary. But how are you going to let the others know so
they can go along with this plan of yours?"
</p><p align=left>
"I don't know. They're concentrating on the drow now, but if I try to tell
anyone else, the Limbo cutters'll figure it out. Can't do that, so we'll
just have to. . . improvise. Open that gate, Dustman!"
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw, scowling, said "You understand I am only following your directives
through concern for my own well being," and began to chant. 
</p><p align=left>
Right. Anyway, I reached within myself and searched for that tiny little
node of attention grabbing magic inside me, waiting for Fretqw to finish
with the gate. Suddenly, a cool sphere of a circle, perfectly formed and
ordered, opened in a perfect blank of a window, pure white. There was no
window, that the gods. That portal itself was orderly enough. If the Limbo
creatures saw a view into the perfect, perfect, painfully straight order of
Mechanus, they'd *really* be unhappy. 
</p><p align=left>
I let loose with the siren song then, which truth to tell, was pitiful for
a siren song. I wouldn't at all mind having a 'bewitch and enslave all hapless
males' type of power, but no such luck. 
</p><p align=left>
The Limbo creatures paused in their determined destructiveness--one of them
had just knocked down the far wall, and the whole room looked wobbly
now--and looked over at the portal. The drow in the room glanced over where
me and the Dustman stood, comprehension lighting their eyes. The two elf
wizards stopped chanting banishing tripe, and began different spells, and
Zaknafein poised, sheathing his swords, and drawing his nifty little whip. 
</p><p align=left>
' I wonder what other uses he could put that to,' I thought with a sudden
grin. No, no, no! I'd been down that path, and while it had been a most
enjoyable experience in itself, the whole results had flung me into a great
deal of unpleasentries. No. Don't think that way! But that moment had
distracted me enough, the imitation siren song faltered, and the Limbo
creatures began to get suspicious. Suddenly, the two drow wizards finished
their chanting and the Limbodians were flung forward towards the portals,
halting at the very edge of it, and Zaknafein lashed out with that whip,
catching the creatures around ankles, wrists, throats, etc,, repeatedly
tripping them into the portal. I tried to take up the damn song again, but
it was a no go. I'd lost my concentration. The Limbodians were going in the
door, but not all them. Jalynfein and the Sorcery berk were chanting again,
and the Limbodians were turning their attention to them. Suddenly, Freqtw
whispered furiously under his breath, and the last three creatures went
spilling in the portal. He changed his tune quickly, chantin' whatever
chant it was that closed the door. The painfully perfect circle disappeared. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw was grinding his teeth beside me. I could hear it with horrible
clarity as the fragile silence hung in the air, and then the Sorcery Master
said to Jalynfein, "When will I have my due, Spider Mage? I've found out
your secret. You shielded these fools, whomever they may be. No one as
devoted to Lloth as you claim to be would do so. One is drow, true, but why
would he be so anxious to leave the sanctity of Lloth's city if he had not
committed a crime?"
</p><p align=left>
"You may believe you have found a secret, Hevary," Jalynfein responded
mildly, "But you were as much a part of this as anyone. You could have
teleported to your lackeys and requested help, but you did not want to
appear weak. Your pride had condemned you. You have no right to speak of
crimes to me. And if you speak to anyone else of them, we shall see who is
the greater, and in the higher favour, won't we?"
</p><p align=left>
The Sorcery Master, Hevary, snarled and said, "What about my price?"
</p><p align=left>
Ah, I knew there was a price in there somewhere. 
</p>

<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Twenty-Two</u></font>
<p align=left>
"You would speak so clearly? I am surprised," Jalynfein said to Havary,
seeming more amused than anything else. 
</p><p align=left>
"I have no choice, any longer. You leave me no choice. I gave you my help,
those years ago and in return you offered your council over the years. But
you avoid it now, and will soon stop altogether. 
I asked for a single price, in return for termination of that bargain. I
stayed close to you and helped you banish the creatures to claim that
price. I will have it."
</p><p align=left>
"What will that price be?" the masked mage's voice was calm and cold, yet
ringing with anticipation none the less. Everyone in the room was poised in
listening. 
</p><p align=left>
"Give me the spell," there was a certain emphasize there that suggested
this was not just any spell, but a certain, long coveted spell. 
</p><p align=left>
"No," the answer was curt and immediate. 
</p><p align=left>
"Very well. Than I shall report your treachery. I care not for your
retorice. I can speak of this to the priestesses unless you give me the
spell," his voice was cold and demanding. 
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein paused for a long moment and then said, "I will not give to you a
spell of such power. It is mine alone. I have created it."
</p><p align=left>
"I found out about it," the other whispered low. 
</p><p align=left>
Okay, this is getting annoying. Having them speak on and on about a spell
and not knowing about it and so forth. But it's not as though I'm going to
interfere. I have some logic left, after all. 
</p><p align=left>
"That matters not. It's mine. I will not give it up."
</p><p align=left>
"Then I challenge you," the other mage said, tone haughty. 
</p><p align=left>
"You challenge me?" Jalynfein said incredulously. "Very well," he shrugged
a moment later. "If you insist."
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein gave an annoyed sigh and walked towards where the door had
crumbled. 
</p><p align=left>
"When you're finished, let me know," he tossed his words out before walking
away. Freqtw shrugged and followed. I, figuring I could get killed if I
stuck on the sidelines of a wizard's duel, quickly followed. I paused
outside though for some sign of fire and wrath. No wrath. No fire either.
Puzzled, I stopped completely. About five minutes later, Jalynfein walked
out and the innkeeper was hauling a drow corpse by it's feet. It was, of
course, Hevary.
</p><p align=left>
"So, I take it you won. I'm rather curious that there weren't any
lightening bolts and such," I remarked to the living drow. 
</p><p align=left>
"Indeed. So was he. He found out that I had developed a spell that could
kill with complete unconsciousness, something that could make the kill look
like a natural death. I think he thought the target needed to be caught
unawares however. I used it on him, sans fire and lightening, just now."
</p><p align=left>
"So, why did you let him blackmail you to begin with?"
</p><p align=left>
"Because by knowing something of what I did, he was prohibited by caution
to speak of me to others. I thought that he would come in handy some day.
And I was right."
</p><p align=left>
"Huh. I suppose you'll be going back to your city, now?"
</p><p align=left>
"Indeed, I will. Tell Zaknafein that it was interesting to see him again,"
he nodded. 
</p><p align=left>
"I thought you had to rest."
</p><p align=left>
"I'll be going to the travel chamber now. Rest or no, I will not be caught
in more of this. It's your adventure."
</p><p align=left>
"Adventure?"
</p><p align=left>
"Well of course."
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, brother," I muttered. "That's a laugh."
</p><p align=left>
I watched as he walked away, and disappeared around the corner. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>
<p align=left>

<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Twenty-Three</u></font>
<p align=left>
I turned around then, only to see a dark, slender form, which radiated
danger from every pore. If it had pores. It seemed to be completely black
and groovless, stalking forward. It hissed at something behind me, and I
heard a voice drawl, 
</p><p align=left>
"I expected your earlier than this, considering that I showed up in your
realm."
</p><p align=left>
"I was informed late. The Bertay jumped upon you first," the thing hissed.
Gods, how I hate people who try to be all dark and mysterious. It's
*really* annoying. "But when my informant arrived, she said that her
"friend" had become involved with you. I've been keeping tabs, but Meg is
quite efficient in doing it for me. She knows quite a bit about you."
</p><p align=left>
"You know not much, and all she knows is less than you do," Zaknafein said,
but I wasn't really interested in the rest. *Meg?* Meg was involved in
this? Meg was this whateveritis's informant? What the hell?! And then I
remembered. Meg had seemed to know more than she should about Zaknafein,
more than a casual listener should. Gods be damn it all! I don't really
care about what people do for a living, but Meg was the only friend I had
that could be called really loyal. And she ratted out on me. Okay, it was
about the drow, but I was involved in it, and she said so! Damn it, damn
it, damn it! I should never have trusted her, for the sake of all powers!
Trust gets you killed, but oh no, Tirysa knows everything, now doesn't she?
Well, apparently not. 
</p><p align=left>
I came back for a brief moment, out of my bitter contemplation's, just in
time to see Zaknafein clash with the thing. And considering that Zaknafein
said we'd been in it's plane, I assume that meant Limbo. Thinking back, I
figured that this was the 'idiot from Limbo' that the weapons master had
once angered. The tiefling, Grew, had mentioned that in the mageshop. I've
got a good memory for details, much good as it does me most of the time. 
</p><p align=left>
This time, I saw the slash of swords and whips and horrid little swirls of
chaos, whirling round and round and round, concentration on the drow's
face, a slight swirling of air around the chaos thing that suggested the
same. It was not match for the drow in combat, but it had magic, and every
time the drow cut through it's body, it simply reformed. Zaknafein saw
this, but he kept simply dancing around with those swords, and what the
hell are you going to do, drow?! I thought to myself, genuine anger
whirling up in my breast at the thought of this being, employing Meg,
getting information from her. Damn it all! And then the drow whirled, whip
curling about the thing like a viper, and it jerked straight forward, and
the drow stabbed it--through the feet, one sword in each. 
And it crumbled to the ground with a groan.  Quickly, the drow sliced it's
feet off entirely. The thing crumbled into dust. Zaknafein stood there for
a moment, looking down at it. 
</p><p align=left>
"It's feet?" I asked, rather faintly. 
</p><p align=left>
"I learned that when I killed one of them, the first time I met them. It's
why this one hated me. Apparently, the other was close to it. The first
almost killed me before I found that out."
</p><p align=left>
"Meg was my friend," I said, "The informant."
</p><p align=left>
He stared at me for a long moment before nodding and saying, "That's what
comes of friends," his lips twisting cynically. "Where is Jalynfein?"
</p><p align=left>
"Gone. Back to that city."
</p><p align=left>
"I see. I'll find Freqtw. We are going back to Sigil. No matter what it
takes."
</p><p align=left>
That sounded good to me. I had business to take care of in Sigil. The only
friend I'd ever trusted had betrayed me. I was eager to find out how she
would enjoy it when I returned the favour.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>
<p align=left>
<a name="24"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Twenty-Four</u></font>
<p align=left>
Freqtw did not have any convenient spells that could take us back to Sigil,
but there were wizards for hire all over Skullport, and we found one of
them quickly enough, one who had some small knowledge of the planes, enough
to get us back home, but the problem was paying the man. 
</p><p align=left>
"How would you transport us? Have you a gate, or would you bring us to
Sigil yourself?" Zaknafein was asking the wizard as we sat in his classy
little study, the drow's voice clipped and business like. 
</p><p align=left> 
"I don't have a standing gate to Sigil," the wizard, a tall, dark skinned
and muscular human man, wearing a golden collar about his neck and a
sleeveless white robe over his body, answered. 
</p><p align=left>
"Then the solution is simple," Zaknafein answered, "I have funds in Sigil.
I will pay you when we get there."
</p><p align=left>
"All very well," the man said, "But I don't live in Sigil. I won't accept
their coinage."
</p><p align=left>
"I can very well exchange the coinage for just about any in the multiverse.
Some of the city dealers work very widely."
</p><p align=left>
"Hmm," the man snorted, his throat tightening, and then expanding again,
"It'll do."
</p><p align=left>
Right. So, then that was settled. Getting back to Sigil didn't seem hard at
all, considering all things. Of course, considering that the man was going
to have to wait for the currency exchange and all, he might get annoyed,
but he'd been warned, and that wasn't my business anyway, as long as
Zaknafein didn't expect me and Freqtw to chip in the bill once we got back.
</p><p align=left>
"Let's go," the man said. 
</p><p align=left>
"Now?" Freqtw demanded, "Don't you have to memorize the spell?"
</p><p align=left>
"Yes," the man said, "I do. But we'll all get to the room in which we'll be
when the transportation takes place, right now. I'll have the cook make you
something. You look hungry."
</p><p align=left>
"Nothing for me, thank you," Zaknafein said then. It made me wonder. What
would it be like to live without food? I mean, I don't live *for* food, but
a lot of it tastes pretty damn good. And he can't drink, either. Can't get
drunk, can't get high either, come to think of it. It all sounded pretty
dull, truth to tell. Being undead must not be so great, but it also looks
better than being down right dead, so I guess the cutter makes do with what
he has. Still. . . .
</p><p align=left>
The wizard shrugged, "If you say so. And the rest of you?"
</p><p align=left>
Fretqw looked up eagerly. "I'll take whatever you're willing to give," he
exclaimed. 
</p><p align=left>
"That goes for me as well," I said. 
</p><p align=left>
The wizard chuckled, the deep, rumbling sound vibrating through the man.
"That's what I thought. Come on."
</p><p align=left>
We arrived in a nicely appointed, pentagon shaped room in which there was a
table, chairs, couches, and the like, as well as cleared floor space in the
middle. The dominate colours were white and gold. The wizard gestured us to
sit wherever and he left again.
</p><p align=left>
I took the moment to study my companions. Freqtw was tugging on his grey
beard, rubbing at his clothing, staring in to space and scowling. He hadn't
said much lately, seemed to be in a perpetual bad mood. Zaknafein was
lounging, cat like and seemingly relaxed in a cushion stuffed chair, the
heel of one of his black boots up at an angle on the other boot. His eyes,
blue when not in the infrared spectrum, were narrowed into slits, and his
face was serious. He didn't look to be a talking mood, either. I wondered
what he was thinking. I wondered what they were both thinking. Myself, I
was thinking that soon this whole thing would be over, I'd be back home,
and then I'd be damned if I ever took a job from the Dustmen again. 
</p><p align=left>
Damn. 
</p><p align=left>
That reminded me of how this whole thing had started. Freqtw still had that
skin component. The Dustmen wanted to control the 'unique undead type' that
the drow was. Zaknafein wanted to the information taken from his skin
sample to counter any plans of theirs. 
</p><p align=left>
I looked back at the drow again. He sent a piercing look at Freqtw, and I
wondered how often he thought about the whole thing himself, and how
worried he was about it. I mean, being a puppet of any faction would not be
pleasant. 
</p><p align=left>
The collared wizard, who's name was Jong, returned with steaming platters
of something. I don't know what it was, but it tasted good. Freqtw and I
devoured our food in the silence, as the wizard himself studied his
spellbook. Some time later, he stood up and asked, 
</p><p align=left>
"Finished?" 
</p><p align=left>
We were. 
</p><p align=left>
"Good. The grub was on the house, but we're ready to go now. Just leave the
plates on the table. The servant will get them later. Now follow me," he
said, standing and walking over to the empty floor space in the middle of
the room. We followed, and once there, the man wasted no time at all in
chanting, business like and efficient, no dramatics, for which was I
thankful. I'd had more than enough of dramatics of late, and that was a
fact. The world snapped once, and blurred about us, shimmering in the air,
and I couldn't see for a second, and then it began to tune in once again. 
</p><p align=left>
I stumbled forward, catching my balance as Zaknafein caught my arm, smiling     
in amusement at me. That smile was about the first truly friendly               
expression I'd seen directed towards me from him, ever, and it fixed in         
with my feelings as the moment as I looked up, seeing the wheel,                
the City of Doors, Sigil.                                                       
</p><p align=left>                                                                                
I was very near home again, very near the city, cause of course, yopu can't     
teleport right into to the city at the center of the multiverse.                
</p><p align=left>                                                                                
"I hate coming here," Jong muttered.                                            
</p><p align=left>                                                                                
Zaknafein began to talk, working out a time and place in which to meet him
with the funds. Jong was apparently confident that he could find the drow
and make him regret not paying him, should Zaknafein not do so. I wasn't so
sure of that, but I was sure that the weapons master wouldn't do that. He
just didn't seem the type. Jong left a moment later. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw, however, was taking the moment in which to creep away. Zaknafein
turned around to the Dustman and said, "Stop right there."
</p><p align=left>
"What?" Freqtw asked irritably. 
</p><p align=left>
"You know what. I want the information."
</p><p align=left>
"I don't have it," the wizard snapped. 
</p><p align=left>
"Don't lie to me. I don't appreciate it," the drow said, his voice sporting
a steely edge. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well *I* don't appreciate being dragged all over the multiverse!" Freqtw
flared, "And I am not going to--"
</p><p align=left>
"I don't care what you don't appreciate. I will have the information. And
you will give it to me. In the mean time, you will stay with me."
</p><p align=left>
"To hell with this!" the wizard shouted, began to chant. 
</p><p align=left>
Oh damn. Not good, not good at all. A lightening bolt arched through the
air, and both Zaknafein and I threw ourselves aside in an instant. The drow
was up then, swords in hand, and I was just over to the side, trying not to
get involved, in the slightest. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw had a look of most deadly determination on his face, vagueness and
annoying looks all vanished in that moment, and he was chanting again,
gesturing with his hands, and Zaknafein was running forward, and Freqtw
threw something--some sort of bright light, not lightening though, and
Zaknafein danced to the side again, and then Freqtw was back against a
wall, and he had no where else to go, and then Zaknafein was sheathing his
swords in an instant, and his whip was lashing out, and Freqtw was chanting
faster than ever, hands gesturing, and I was waiting, seeing who would get
there first, tensing in anticipation, and suddenly there was a gash of
black leather 
whip and a spurt of blood, and piercing scream of pain, and Freqtw was on
his knees, crying out in horror, hands scrambling at his mouth, and I
looked at the whip, eyes widening as I saw the wizard's tongue caught in
it's coils.
</p><p align=left>
"I trust you understand me now?" Zaknafein asked, not a hint of lightness
in that voice, nothing but steel. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw screamed again, rawly, gurgling on blood, glaring and suddenly he
was crying and I was gapping, thinking 'At least you're still alive, buddy'
and then it hit me. He was alive, but he wouldn't be for long. Wizards need
words, need tongues to speak those words, to use their spells. Freqtws
magic had advanced him and kept him alive through his life, no doubt, and
now the instrument of his words--his tongue--was gone. As soon as Zaknafein
had what he wanted, the man would be dead, probably sooner than later, by
whatever enemies he had. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow strode forward, snapping the whip once more to free the tongue
from the coils. He picked it up, carefully, and tore a square of cloth from
his cloak. He carefully wrapped the tongue in the cloth, and then secreted
it in the pouch at his belt. 
</p><p align=left>
"This will keep for a small while," the drow said, "If you give me what I
want, with no further arguments, I shall give you your tongue back. There
are those who can sew such things back on, and you can return to your
livelihood as though nothing had happened to take you from it."
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw's look was suddenly filled with sickening hope. He stared at the
pouch at the drow mercenary's belt with desperate eyes. 
</p><p align=left>
"Do you agree?" Zaknafein asked. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw nodded, and Zaknafein said, "Good."
</p><p align=left>
"I take it I can go?" I asked, annoyed by the tremor in my voice. 
</p><p align=left>
"You can go. Good luck with your 'friend,' Tirysa," Zaknafein said, then
reminding me in a rush of that business I had with Meg.  
</p><p align=left>
"Thanks," I said, and walked away.

<p align=left>
I'd gone home, cleaned up, armed myself appropriately, caught some
refreshing sleep,  and worked myself up into a satisfactory form of fury
and betrayal before I went across town to confront my dear friend. The door
to her abode wasn't locked, and I slipped in without having to pick locks
or bang down doors or what have you, stopping right into the living room. 
</p><p align=left>
"Hello, Meg," I said when I saw her, sitting at her table, my voice
dangerously calm. 
</p><p align=left>
"Tirysa," she said, shock reverberating strongly. Well, well. It seemed she
hadn't expected to see me any time soon. I wonder why? My sarcasm is thick,
of course. 
</p><p align=left>
"What are you doing?" I asked, looking somewhat puzzled at her reaction to
my appearance. 
</p><p align=left>
"I'm just writing in my journal," she said. 
</p><p align=left>
"You know, I always found the idea of a journal to be dangerous. I mean,
anyone can look into it and discover your secrets, right? And even if
you're smart enough not to record incriminating incidents, they can still
pick up ideas about your character, or even what your favorite food is,
just so they can poison it. Very careless, a journal."
</p><p align=left>
"It's a history," she shrugged, and I smiled. She'd always been fond of
history. Well, babe, I thought viciously,  soon you're going to be history
yourself.  
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, it is," I said outwardly, taking a seat. "So, what have you been
doing this last while?" I asked, inwardly thinking, *Besides ratting me
out.*
</p><p align=left>
"This and that," she shrugged. 
</p><p align=left>
"I ran into an old friend of yours," I smiled, all a friend letting the
other know of a passing incident, an excuse to rehash old times, as it
were. Right. 
</p><p align=left>
"Really?" she asked, face blank. 
</p><p align=left>
"Really," I answered, "Interesting cutter. Seemed to be made of shadows."
</p><p align=left>
She gasped, shocked, standing to her feet in a motion shockingly quick for
one of her race. Daggers appeared quickly in her hand, and she sent one
flying towards me without warning. I threw myself forward into a roll,
coming up several feet from her, my own daggers in my hands. She hissed,
throwing another which narrowly missed my right eye. It clattered onto the
floor, and she cursed, snarling, running towards where her first dagger had
fallen, retrieving it, dodging my own strikes. On and on and on, dodging
and rolling, until finally there was nothing for her to do, nowhere for her
to go, backed up against the table as she was. 
</p><p align=left>
"I don't like being betrayed," I hissed, glaring fiercely at her. 
</p><p align=left>
"Like you always say, Tirysa," she spat, "It's just business."
</p><p align=left>
"Ya, well, it's going to be dead business pretty soon," I snapped, "At
least I know how to pick my jobs correctly."
</p><p align=left>
"Right. Like the last one, huh?"
</p><p align=left>
"Shut up," I muttered, letting my hand fly forward, ready to sink the blade
I held into her eye, right through into her brain. 
</p><p align=left>
Just before it entered, her hand flashed back to the table, grabbing
something, parrying quickly, and sinking the blade right into my stomach.
Gods be damned it hurt! I howled, doubling over, which just made it worse,
seeing as the blade was in my middle. Groaning, I sank to the floor. Meg
stood above me, reaching down. I tensed, vaguely wondering what she would
do now.
Wrapping her stubby fingers around the thing in my stomach, she pulled out
a gilded, jeweled silver letter opener, made to split paper, but just as
rending to flesh. I gapped, and began to laugh in shock, and then gasped
again, because it hurt like hell, and trying to laugh and gasping only made
it even worse. 
</p><p align=left>
"Goodbye, my friend," she said gravely, and I wanted to spit on her, but I
was in too much pain for even that, and besides, I was going to die right,
so why ruin the solemnity of the moment? Maybe, she'd get me cremated,
instead of letting my body to rot in the alley way, I pondered lucidly, if
I didn't spit on her. Besides, I couldn't have summoned the energy. It was
all I could do to keep holding onto my stomach. 
</p><p align=left>
The letter opener--imagine! dying by letter opener!--came up high for a
strike, angled for my heart this time. I closed my eyes, never even
pretending that I wasn't frightened near to death, which is exactly where
I'd be going soon enough. 
</p><p align=left>
The strike never hit me. 
</p><p align=left>
A thud rent the air, and the smashing of pottery, and I opened my eyes,
groaning, only to see Meg's final, shocked as she lay amidst the pottery
that had fallen when the crosstrading gnome hit the shelf on the wall,
pieces of them piercing right through her throat. 
</p><p align=left>
And who should I see standing over me but the grim master himself,
Zaknafein Do'Urden. 
</p><p align=left>
"I had some spare time," he said, "And I thought you might need some help."
</p><p align=left>
Maybe there's something to the undead after all. At least, some of them. 
</p><p align=left>
I tried to smile, but it was just too much effort. Blackness closed in, and
I pitched over on my face. 
</p>

<p align=left>
"Yes, sir," a voice said hazily, or I heard hazily, or something like that,
"She'll be fine. She's just exhausted. Her strength needs to be recovered."
</p><p align=left>
"Good," another voice said, and it seemed familiar, but I couldn't quite
remember it. 
</p><p align=left>
And then I went back to sleep.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=25%>
<p align=left>
"Planning on waking up any time soon?" that voice asked matter of factly. 
</p><p align=left>
I opened my eyeing, carefully, feeling the light from the magical balls
spaced around the room invade my eyes. Squinting, I eyed Zaknafein, who was
leaning against the wall, smiling in slight amusement. 
</p><p align=left>
"I think I am," I said hoarsely. 
</p><p align=left>
"It's about time," he answered.
</p><p align=left>
"How long?" I asked. 
</p><p align=left>
"Three days. You almost didn't make it to the clerics. Once she healed you,
however, there was only the matter of regaining your strength."
</p><p align=left>
"The clerics?" I grumbled, "Ugh. Priests."
</p><p align=left>
"They saved your life," he shrugged, and the last while came flooding back
to me. 
</p><p align=left>
"Meg is dead," I whispered. 
</p><p align=left>
"Yes," he replied simply. 
</p><p align=left>
Dead. Gone. Forever. The only friend I'd ever thought I'd truly had. Dead.
She'd betrayed me, but still, she'd been my friend, for a while. Before
that. 
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein was eyeing me, and I just knew then that he knew what I was
thinking. 
</p><p align=left>
"So," I said, struck by a question, "Why did you save me?"
</p><p align=left>
He shrugged and said, "I've become fond of you. And I know where I stand.
You are unusually frank, Tirysa," he smiled. 
</p><p align=left>
"So I've been told. It hasn't served me so well, until now," but I was glad
it had. 
</p><p align=left>
"Now it has. Don't expect me to be around for you all the time, though," he
said, a smile tugging at his lips. 
</p><p align=left>
"Yeah right, cutter," I snapped, "I don't depend on anyone to take care of
me. I'm grateful for this, but--"
</p><p align=left>
He chuckled, and I blushed. I mustn't have been so clear-headed then, cause
I walked right into that one. 
</p><p align=left>
"Wait a minute," I said, "What happened with Freqtw and the whole skin
thing?"
</p><p align=left>
He eyed me for a long moment, and I grew uncomfortable under the scrutiny
before he said, "I suppose I can tell you. I took back the skin, and he
told me what he's found out about it. Which was that I am not susceptible
to any conventional methods of controlling undead, save for the original
spell, which requires me to have been in the plane that I went to after my
original death, and then be summoned by a will strong enough. Basically,
the one who did to begin with was the only one who could have, and I broke
away from control and stayed in my body, so the control is negated now,
completely. The wizard could not find any other method, save to expel my
soul, and re-summon it, which would be very difficult indeed. He had not
passed on the information yet, and so only I have it--as well as the skin,
which I had the cleric replace in my arm," he smiled, pulling up his
sleeve, showing an unblemished, perfectly formed arm. 
</p><p align=left>
"Won't he just go tell the Dustmen?" I asked. 
</p><p align=left>
His eyes hardened, and he said, "You don't seriously believe that I let him
live? He was running on blind hope, and would have done as you say, and
been eager for vengeance, had I left him with life, let alone had his
tongue attached back."
</p><p align=left>
"So you lied," I said, wondering why I hadn't thought of it before.
Wondering why the wizard hadn't either. What idiocy, I snorted silently.
He'd been running on hope as the drow said, unable to make himself think of
it, and I can't even figure out why I didn't. Just too shocked over the
whole matter to think maybe. Or something. It was stupid and slow of me,
but that's the way it was. 
</p><p align=left>
"I lied," he agreed. 
</p><p align=left>
"What do I owe you?" I asked, thinking of the no doubt abominable cleric's
bill. 
</p><p align=left>
"This was on the house, courtesy of myself," he said, grinning, showing his
teeth, the look in his eyes nothing less than feral. "Take care of
yourself, my friend," he said, turning around and walking out of the door.
Leaving me to lay back in the bed, smoothing the crisp white sheets.
Friend. What a strange friend for me, indeed. Or not so strange, depending
upon your perspective, I thought wryly. 
</p><p align=left>
The pattering suddenly startled the roof of the building. Once again, it
was raining in Sigil. The smell of would-be oil filled the air, and I
rolled over to bury my face in the cleric's crisp white pillow.

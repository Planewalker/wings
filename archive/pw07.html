<p align=left>
The Gensai named Akon was rather friendly, the other Gensai, the one I
had to knock out was Shara. She wasn't friendly. She continued to flirt with
me, then spouted out a number of explitives. Of course I needed to gag her
again. Akon knows how to leave the Waste, and we started walking towards the
gate. A gate was a link to another world. Strangely Akon didn't want me to kill
Shara, not that I would, she's rather helpless now. So we took her with us. At
first she wasn't too cooperative, so I strapped her to my back and continued
on. The gensai was only maybe a hundred pounds. With all the training and
fighting, this was nothing. As we get closer to the gate, someone appeared.</p><p align=left>

"Greetings mortals, what brings you to the Waste?" My hand went to Derra, and
pointed it at the creature. "I don't think that is necessary." the creature
said. It was six foot tall, with a fox-like head with a devious smile. From
what I heard among "Boot Camp". It was an Arcanoloth, a greater Yugoloth, these
are the most devious of the fiends, who will betray you in a second. "What do
you want fiend?" Derra started sending me waves telling me that this was indeed
a fiend, if I had any doubt, and thoroughly evil. Akon's sword was also trained
on the 'loth. He didn't seem much concerned with him. "My aren't you testy. I
mean you no harm."</p><p align=left>

Suddenly the straps on my back broke and Shara plopped to the ground,  behind
me. Her gag must have dropped off, because she spoke. "Help me Arcanoloth. I
will pay you three thousand gold if you slay that Gensai and capture the Blood
Warrior who captured me." A hideous laugh blasted out the fiend's throat.
"Ridiculous, that is much too low a price and you don't have the gold." Shara
answered "Fool! My power is the power of the thieves. I can get all the gold I
need." The 'loth replied "He's too busy running from the Chaos Hound. The Berk.
You are a priestess of the thief power, and I doubt weapon less you will be
able to get away, much less defeat Bane." My eyes widen "How did you know my
name?" The fiend replied "Easy Basher, ESP is easy for a Yugoloth! I know a lot
of things. besides I'm here to help you." Never trust a fiend. "You don't trust
me? I can get you to Sigil, I'll even set you up with some jink, even magic
items that you might find interesting, and a gem." Derra spoke "Just kill him
Bane, 'Loth's are the worse kind of fiend." The fiend smirked "So the fiend
slayer sword speaks. I can offer your possessor a way out of this burg, and
cash to boot, including this diamond." The fiend pulled out a gem the size of
his palm. "The magic item, I can't touch. It's not very useful to yugoloths,
but to you, it'd work just fine." Derra 'looked' at the items. "No he will
betray you." The fiend smiled "No, actually if you kill this Baatezu group, and
they are stalking after you anyway. your "friends" are coming for you. Slay
them all and I'll give you the items and I'll teleport you and your friends to
the Gate, and you'll be free to leave to Sigil."</p><p align=left>

"Well they will come after me. How many of them are after me. Derra is going to
detect if you are lying." The fiend looks at me and says "twenty Black Abashai,
and a Red Abashai leader." I turn to Akon. "Are you a good mage?" Akon replied
"You aren't seriously thinking about fighting them all?" I nod. "I know they
won't leave me alone, so they'll leave me alone if I kill them all. You don't
need to aid me." Akon looked at me and lets out a sigh. "All right, I'll help
you, but what are we going to do with her?" The thief-priestess was slinking
off, trying to get away from us. "Let her go, she's not likely to get where she
needs to go." Shara stopped, as if the realization of what I said struck her.
She came back to us in a slow moping walk. "Bastard! I'll gut you. I hope those
fiends rip your heart out!" A laugh pushed out "I guess I will have to
disappoint you, I know these Abashai. They don't have the guts. Too bad you
can't help us." The gensai grimaced "You think I am going to fight those
fiends, you are plain barmy! I'm going out on my own." I smile. "Your choice
Shara." I flipped her dagger to her. "Here's your dagger, poison free. You
should survive just fine out here on your own." Her dagger rocketed towards me.
My hand came up and grabbed it by the pommel. Her eyes raised in astonishment.
"Don't want your dagger Shara? Fine. See you in the next life. Let's go Akon."
</p><p align=left>

Akon has a big grin on his face. There was no place to hide, and I could see
the twenty-one fiends coming our way. "Akon, can you cast a spell to hurt the
fiends?" The mage nodded "Yes, but it won't hurt them much, but it will hit all
of them." Quickly I say "Do it." The mage starts murmuring. A fireball streaked
out and blasted the group of fiends. It staggered the fiends, none of them
fell, but they streak down toward us. Akon cast another spell and three
missiles streaked over and struck one of the Abashai. This one fell from the
sky. I load some silver bolts as Akon cast three more missiles. I fired my hand
crossbow, and two bolts struck one of the fiends. There were only 18 left. Akon
and I take two more down before they were in striking distance. Derra blazed
out and whacked the fiend and split him in two. The Air Gensai slashed one, and
it fell as well. The fiends streaked down and clawed and bite.. They slashed at
us and bit. </p><p align=left>

Our swords slashed and hacked at the fiends. Claws struck and bit our skin.
Through all the black and red blood running through my sight was the Red
Abashai. My sword cut through him like a knife through butter. I spin around,
and more Abashai fell. I could no longer see Akon, but I could hear him still
slashing. More fiends drop. I could no longer feel the claws cutting into me.
The number declined and the fiends corpses are down. Akon fell, but it looked
like someone was on him. I jump at the invisible intruder. The body was soft
and supple, and when I try to hold her down I felt female parts. Her hand
struck at me. I stopped it with mine. We struggle and I felt lips pressed
against mine. Shara became visible to me now. She was an attractive woman, but
venomous. I tried to pull away from her because I knew Akon was dying. She
pulled me back to her. "Let him die, take me." Her lips savagely sucked on
mine, and my body burned hot. Suddenly my mind kicked back in place, I slipped
a vial with her poison in my hand. Quickly I forced a dose down her throat.
"you basss........." Her struggle stopped.</p><p align=left>

I knew Akon was in bad shape. I started bandaging his body. He was still alive,
but he'd be out for even longer than Shara. I wasn't in great shape myself. My
bandages were wet with my blood. A groan issued out from Akon, but he rolled
over and lay there asleep. Shara looked mad, and I started to regret a little
about stopping our tryst, but if I hadn't, Akon would have died, and if it
wasn't for him, the fiends would have beaten us. Not only did she not help, she
tried to kill him too. My head felt really bad. I needed to get away from this
plane. The fiend appeared again. "Greetings Bane, you did well. Here is your
reward." He pulled out a bag. "The contents contain five thousand in Planar
gold, the diamond I showed you previously, two teleporters, and a gate key to
Sigil." I took the bag. "What are the teleporters for?" The fiend grinned "The
first leads you to the magic items I told you about. The second will take you
to the Gate."  My mind still wasn't clear. "Fine, thank you fiend." The fiend
snorted "Rude mortal meat aren't you, you don't even know my name." My eyes
crossed him, and my hand moved to Derra, and pointed at him. "If you mean to
attack us now." The fiend replied "Oh no, you did me a great service. One thing
I like about good cutters is I can get them to kill my enemies but only if they
are portrayed as being evil. We will meet again, and you will be apt to work
with me again. The name mortals call me is Metran, by the way. Call me by name
if you have more need for some jink." The fiend gave me a wink and then
disappeared.</p><p align=left>

Akon wasn't looking good. His wounds were soaked with blood. His breathing was
shallow. He would die on this plane if I didn't do something about it. "Derra?
Can you heal Akon?" Derra's voice echoed out "Yes, but you need healing
yourself." I replied "I'll live, but Akon won't if you don't heal him." Derra
sent a pleasant buzz through my hands. "Touch my tip to him, and I'll heal
him." I placed her blade down on Akon, and a white light filled him, and his
wounds quickly vanished. Akon's sky blue eyes opened. "Welcome to the land of
the living." I helped Akon up. "What happened?"  I told him the story about
using my sword to heal him. I refrained from telling her the story about the
hot lip lock between Shara and myself. I showed him the teleporter and I pulled
it out and Akon peered at it. Then he rubbed the teleporter. Before I could say
anything, we were in a new place.</p><p align=left>

The teleporter took all of us, including the unconscious Shara. A Cave entrance
loomed in front of us. It stank of fresh blood. "I don't like the look of
this." A pair of large red eyes peered out at us from the cave. "So, these are
the berks the Fiend sent for me. Good.... a lot of good eating." Akon and I
drew our weapons. Flames lashed out of the cave, and we leapt out of the way.
Shara was nowhere to be seen, but obviously she turned invisible and fled. The
dragon came out of the cave. It's red scales glistened as it moved, they ran
over his huge frame. I was no dragon expert, but this one looked like it just
reached adulthood. "Don't want to be well-done? I could eat you raw too." I
rushed the dragon and slashed with Derra. Derra cut into the side of the
scales, they didn't seem as powerful as they looked, either that or Derra is
more powerful than she looked. The Dragon slashed and bit at me. This
distraction allowed Akon to cast a lightning bolt at the dragon.  It hurt the
beast, but it didn't stop him. Flames lapped out his mouth at Akon, some of
them broke his bluish skin, he crumpled to the ground. The dragon growled in
triumph "One down, one to go." </p><p align=left>

I was certain I was dead, but I certainly couldn't run. Derra cleaved into him
again. This seemed to hurt him even more than before. I was too close for him
to blast me. "I'll eat you raw!" His huge maw came down and engulfed me. I was
standing inside his mouth. I jammed my shield down his throat, and it
definitely caught. Flames sputtered out past the shield. I slashed the dragons
tongue, which was underneath me. Derra cleaved it in half. The Dragon shrieked,
I shot out his mouth with my shield and flames. I crashed with a thud, my whole
body screamed out painfully. Turning to look at the dragon, he was in shock
looking at his fallen tongue laying on the gray earth. I lifted Derra and my
shield and ran straight for the dragon. Even though I was far from quiet, I was
able to catch him off guard and drive my blade through his upper shoulder.
Derra was lodged in the beast and I couldn't pull her out. The big beast
thrashed around. Without Derra, my only weapon was my crossbow. I quickly
loaded it. Two bolts flew and bounced off his scaly hide. Flames blasted
towards me. I pulled up my shield to block the flood of flames. Most of it was
stopped by my shield, but my lower armor was cooked by it. The hot metal was
burning into my legs. I took out my silver dagger and slashed the straps that
held my grieves on, so they fell off. My thighs were  burnt and my shins were
red and burning. Two more bolts bounced off his massive frame. Suddenly another
bolt of lightning struck the dragon, Akon was still alive, still in bad shape,
but alive. </p><p align=left>

The light in the beast's eyes died out, he stopped moving and his lids shut for
his forever sleep on this hellish plane. I walked towards the dragon, and
pulled Derra from his shoulder. "Excellent work Bane, you are a warrior worthy
of me." I flushed with embarrassment. "by the way, the water gensai didn't
leave, she's in the cave." I looked over at Akon who was trying to recover
himself. "Will you be okay Akon?" The Gensai's skin still had a reddish glow,
but he nodded. He was in bad shape, but he looked like he would be okay, so I
rushed into the cave.</p><p align=left>

I could hear someone in here, but no one could be seen. A large amount of
treasure was here. Gold, silver and platinum coins, some glowing items lay in
the pile as well. "Look out!" Shrieked Derra, and I dropped to the ground. A
flash of blade streaked over my head, and I could feel a body above me. I
jumped at the body and it felt like I hit a soft form. I grabbed, and caught a
leg. The body dropped. A glowing dagger came at me, and it slashed my side. A
screaming pain echoed through me. It hurt much more than what a dagger should
have done. I punched at the invisible form and struck it's face squarely. The
body stopped moving and the dagger dropped on the ground. The body
materialized, and I wasn't surprised to see that it was Shara. I tried to pick
up the dagger but it burned my hand. The gensai jumped up and kissed me hard.
Shara had a succulent taste to her lips, and my body grew hot as her body
pressed tight against mine. Our lips parted "Take me." This was one strange
woman. She tried to kill me, and now she wants to have sex. As evil as I know
she is, it was difficult to not do what she wanted me to do. She already had
her hand down toward my cod piece. I grabbed her hand. "No." I said to her,
even though every fiber in my being wanted her. The only thing that held me
back was that I didn't know whether we would finish the act, or if she would
try to kill me again. "Why? You won me. I am yours. Ravage me." She brought my
hands up to her breasts. Her body felt like running my hands through water, but
there was definite firm mounds. She moaned with desire as my hands ran over
her. "I've always wanted someone who was worthy of taking me." She reached down
and pulled off the lower portion of her leather armor. I stood up. "No. Not
here, not with a woman like you."</p><p align=left>

Shara's eyes flared "What do you mean `A woman like me?' I am more woman than
any normal man deserves. You should thank your power that I am giving you this
pleasure!" I replied "An evil woman like you, one who tries to kill me?" Shara
looked at me sweetly "I had to try, if you had died, you wouldn't be worthy of
me." In an insane way, it almost made sense. I looked at myself, I was still
blood stained, hardly something that would be attractive to the opposite sex.
"Well....." I was rather stunned that she would want me. While she wasn't
human, she was built like a woman, but with smooth greenish skin, firm shapely
figure and long black hair and sultry green eyes. While a thing of beauty, I
could see the angst in her, and looks definitely like the evil seductress she
is. Derra spoke for me. "You are an evil bitch is what he's trying to say. A
woman without any sense of honor or love." Shara smirked "You'll have me, you
wait a little longer and you won't be able to resist." Sadly, she was right, it
took all I had to resist her now. It helped that I wasn't really in the mood
for coupling as it was, but if I wasn't burnt, bloody, and she wasn't trying to
kill me........"Bane, the treasure!"</p><p align=left>

Derra's voice brought me out of my thoughts. I turned around and saw glimmering
gold and silver coins in a huge pile. It definitely looked as if someone took a
portion of it for herself. Of course she didn't lift a hand to help us. A
beautiful shining shield with a black rose as the standard lay in the pile,
along with a number of other goods. Potions, scrolls, gems and jewelry. "The
Shield would be perfect for us. It radiates strong magic. So do the potions,
the scrolls, and an amulet hidden under the mound of coins. It's radiating an
aura of good, it may be the magic item the fiend spoke of." I filled my coin
purse with coins. And pocketed some huge gems, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and
such. Underneath was a large gold amulet. It glowed with a white aura, that
couldn't be squelched by the gray waste. "He must have collected this treasure
for a long time. Why didn't it turn gray?" Derra replied "Magic, the dragon had
a spell to keep everything in this cave at it's current glamour. Now that he is
dead, it will turn to past, and become gray." A noise came from cave entrance,
I turned and saw a burnt Akon, I also noticed that Shara was scooping coins,
putting coins in every hidden spot in her body. I would have complained more,
but there was more than enough coins here that even the three of us couldn't
carry it all. "Are you all right Akon?" Akon grimly nodded. "I am fine, where
was the she-bitch when we could have used her help?" Shara smiled sweetly "I'm
helping carrying the treasure." I whispered to Derra "Detect magic." A few
rings on her hands glowed and so did her dagger, most powerfully.  A stab of
pain struck me in the side. I looked and found that the wound that Shara stuck
me with, it was getting worse and bleeding profusely. I issued a bellow. Shara
looked up. "Hmm..." She walked over very sultry and examined the wound. "Looks
bad. I can heal you, for a price." I replied "What price might that be? We have
plenty of gold." Shara smirked "You know what I want." </p><p align=left>

I knew what she wanted. I tried to staunch the bleeding, to no avail. "It's no
use Bane, this dagger is magical, and it's not going to stop bleeding until you
get healed by me." I looked over the potions that were glowing in the pile. I
lifted a blue bottle and popped the cork. Akon smiled, but looked warily with
anticipation and hope. I lightly turned over the bottle so only a drop hit my
tongue. The liquid tingled in my mouth, almost a numbing feeling on my tongue.
The liquid was sweet, I swallowed a little more, and I could feel the wound
start to close. For some reason I figured a bluish potion would be a healing.
Akon came over to me as soon as he noticed that the potion was a healing one. I
handed him the bottle which still had plenty of fluid in. He gulped the whole
thing and he recovered completely. Shara scowled. I noticed that there were two
more with bluish liquid, a bottle of red (couldn't be too good) and a green one
(again, a little bit leery). I picked up the potions and gave them to Akon. He
pocketed them in his pouches, which were the only articles of clothing that
weren't scorched. </p><p align=left>

I fished through the pile of coins and found an amulet. The power was glowing
off of it like a bright sun. It felt good, it's energy was emitting, beckoning
me. I put the amulet on, and I felt like I was touched by God. A light filled
me, and I felt protected. Akon looked at the amulet and said "Let me see that
amulet." The blue skinned man came up to me and looked at the symbol on the
amulet, which was a burning red sky with a sword pointing down to the bottom.
"It's a Godsman artifact! This was what I was supposed to find." He tried to
pull the amulet off my neck, but it wouldn't budge. I realized that it was the
least I could do was to return it to him. I pulled the amulet off, and it
released easily, but I could almost hear it tell me not to take it off. I
handed it to Akon. "By the Source, Ambar will be pleased to see this."
Something else was glowing in the pile that I didn't notice before. It was a
large gem. I sifted through the gold coins to pick it up. There wasn't much
light in the cave, but the gem was pulsing with energy, a blink of light in
this large blue gem. </p><p align=left>

Shara came over to me and the pulsing in the gem grew, twice as large as it has
been. "What's this?" She brought her hand up to try to take the gem. I grabbed
her hand harshly. "It's not yours, you took enough treasure as it was." Shara
gave a false look of shock. "I only took some gold..." Her only redeeming
quality was her beauty, I broke in "and some rings and the dagger you nearly
killed me with." Her dagger came out "Maybe I should kill you with it now?" I
pulled Derra out and slapped her hand with the flat of her blade. The dagger
flew to the back of the cavern. "Don't mess with me, or your corpse will be
rotting on the Waste." Shara's face turned from actual shock to her own smirk.
</p><p align=left>

"You wouldn't hurt me, not only do you want me, but you are a goodie-goodie
basher, who wouldn't harm a woman." She was almost right. Derra slashed at her
and struck her shoulder, her blood trickled down her sensual figure. "You are
really going to die for that!" She was taken aback, but I didn't impress how
serious I was about this. I rushed her and slammed her down against the coins
"Don't fuck with me bitch." Shara's face softened. "Take me Bane." She pushed
her lips against mine. I pushed her away. "Are you insane?" She smiled slyly to
me. "I want you." My eyes rolled in their sockets. What am I going to do with
this woman?</p><p align=left>

What a city! I know I couldn't have lived here, who could live in this
cage? Sigil is a fairly large city, I couldn't even guess how many beings live
in Sigil. I mean beings, as there are a huge number of creatures, there are
fiends here. I've seen Baatezu, Tanar'ri, and a Yugoloth, and he was a merchant
no less! Akon told me that the Lady of Pain rules this city and no open
fighting is allowed, or the Hardheads, which is some sort of watchdogs that try
to stop such things. This seems to keep most people in line. I also hear that
the ruler is some sort of Power called The Lady of Pain. I also hear that she
may have been a Tanar'ri Lord, which is some great power over in the Abyss.
Akon walked us along the walkway, he suggested to try not to make eye contact
with any of the people, as that would put a body in the dead book. So I tired
to walk down the way. Shara was with us, no matter how much we wanted to get
rid of her, she  would find us. She has stopped trying to kill me. A set of
foul eyes peered at me. "What are you looking at berk?" It was a huge Tanar'ri,
with orange skin, spiked ridges, and long tail. This creature while similar to
the Cornigon who "enlisted" me, this one was huge, and was definitely not a
Baatezu. The huge fiend got into my path and put his large hand on my shoulder.
"I'm looking at the next name in the Dead Book, if you don't take your hand off
my shoulder. The fiend didn't see any fear in my eyes, considering deep down I
was frightened. Something caught the fiends eye. "We aren't finished, berk."
The large fiend stomped away. Apparently there were a number of the
Mercykillers marching by. Akon explained to me that Mercykillers believe that
when a crime is committed, that the criminal should be punished immediately.
While Akon believed that the fiend could kill all the Mercykillers, but they
could summon more, and he would be banished from Sigil.</p><p align=left>

Still, even if he was a Balor, I wasn't afraid of this big fiend, though, I
have put enough fiends in the dead book, and he wouldn't be the last. We
continued down the road towards what Akon called The Great Hall. Shara was
close behind "The Great Hall, why do you want to go there? Why don't you ditch
the air dancing berk, and you and I can go dancing, have some fun." Then she
pressed herself close to me. She was hard to resist, but I was able to push her
off. "Why do you keep fighting me? I know you want me, no mortal can resist. Or
are you into men?" My first thought was to smack her, but I reserved that
thought. "Maybe I'm not into you." Shara smirked. "All men want me." My eyes
narrow "Not this man." </p><p align=left>

The Great Hall seemed to be one of the few places that didn't seem to change,
most buildings looked very temporary. Akon led us in, the building was
luxurious. A large number of people looked very pleasant until they saw me.
Obviously it had to do with the fact that I looked like a blood stained warrior
walking into a high society ball. Akon saw that their reactions, so he led me
to a bathing chamber. It was beautiful, a large marble sunken pool. A number of
attractive women were pouring hot water into the pool, and it's almost full.
"Greetings fair ladies, can my good warrior friend bathe before meeting the
Factol?" The women looked at him like he was some noble, giving him royal
respect. "I'm sorry, Lord Akon, this bath was mention for Lady Christine.." A
sweet, feminine voice came up from behind me. "Oh it's just fine ladies.." I
turned and found a  incredible woman. "It looks like this warrior needs bathing
a lot more than I do." This woman must be Lady Christine. She was beautiful,
long brown hair and sparkling blue eyes. Christine was a small woman with a
beautiful shape and form. I could smell a wonderful perfume coming off of her
as if it was natural cologne. My tongue tied, as I looked upon her beauty.
Christine smiled at me, as I gawked at her, and finally I was able to speak.
"No, my good lady, I will find another place to get cleaned up." Again her eyes
twinkled. "Nonsense, you are also meeting the factol. I want you to look your
best for factol Ambar. Please, I insist."</p><p align=left>

I wasn't about to argue with her. I needed clean, and I think there was nothing
I could refuse her. "Thank you my lady.." I said. Her smile broadened, and I
couldn't hear Shara behind me making retching noises anymore. It felt like the
only two people in the world was her and I. "Well, I will leave you to get
cleaned up. See you soon.." My heart raced like the wings of a hummingbird.  As
I watched her leave, I could see how alluring she was. She was wearing a light
white dress, that fit perfectly to her hourglass form. She wore white slippers,
that touched quietly to the floor as she left. I would see her again, she said.
She disappeared from view, and Shara dropped in front. "Could you possibly quit
drooling? What does that pitiful mortal woman have, that I don't have?"  My
thoughts raced, my answer came. "A lot more." She didn't need to know that I
thought Christine had unearthly beauty, full of sweetness, and love. Shara was
attractive and seductive, however her evil tendencies and insane antics has
made her much less appealing. </p><p align=left>

She sneered at me and walked out of the room. Akon smiled "Have a good bath."
Akon and the other Godsmen left, and the women who had prepared the bath,
completed the job and left, shutting the door behind them. I removed my armor,
still had stains of blood on and after ten minutes of tugging, all my armor
pieces were sitting on the floor. Derra sat gently down next to my armor and I
swear I heard her whistle as I disrobed. The water was warm, and the flakes of
blood washed off. I took the water and started scrubbing my flesh. The water
started to change to a dull brown color and more of it was washed up. My body
seemed clear, and the red from my face washed away. Seems the heat that came
from Baator bronzed my skin and the training and the fighting has muscled my
body. It was incredible, I began to think that maybe I would have a chance with
a beautiful woman like Christine.</p><p align=left>

Something came towards me in the water. I turned around, and the nude form of
Shara was there. "What are you doing here?"  She tried to give her sweetest
smile, attempting to emulate Christine. "My, I was right, you do look better
with all the Baatezu blood off of you.." Making sure to hide my private region
under the water, I speak "I said, what are you doing here?" She comes closer,
and unlike myself, she left her privates out in the open for me to see. She was
right, any man would want her. Besides being beautiful, she had a shapely body
and large breasts. My urge was to touch her and give her what she wants, but
something was telling me that it was wrong. "How many times do I have to tell
you "no"?"  Shara pressed her body up against mine, and her soft parts aroused
me. "See, your mind is saying `no', but your body is saying `yes'." Yeah the
part of my body that was saying "yes" was rubbing against her stomach. She
smiled ruefully, and attempted to get our bodies to merge. I managed to pull
myself back, and she dropped into the water. A normal woman would have slipped
and fell over, but she quickly shifted into a position where we were physically
connected. It was absolutely incredible, but as much as I wanted to savor the
moment, I pushed her off. She gave me a sweet smile "Why do you deny yourself
the pleasure I want to give you?"  She tried getting back into that position
again. I pushed her back. What was I doing? "You'll give in sooner or later."</p><p align=left>

My mind was in a daze. A battle between my brain which was telling me that she
was evil, and it would be wrong. I said to Shara "Look! No means No!" where did
I hear that before?  I pulled myself out of the water and grabbed for my for a
towel. She looked between my legs at my hardened member. She smirked. "Come on,
I know a good use for that." The blood flowed to my cheeks as I wrapped the
towel around me. It did little to hide my protruding member that turned my
towel into a tent. I closed my eyes and thought of an unattractive creature. It
was much like willing it down when needing to go to the bathroom. Through sheer
will and clearing my mind and thoughts of a Pit Fiendess in the nude, it
receded down to normal. Shara got out of the tub, the water seemed to cling to
her body in a way that didn't seem right. I've heard of nymphs, sometimes being
romantically inclined to mortals, but where I knew this information from, I
couldn't guess. She seemed completely at one with the water. Purposely she
allowed a full view of her nude form again. I rushed and grabbed my clothes,
and my sword. "BACK OFF!" Shara smiled with her sweet and sour grin. "You won't
kill me, you want me too bad."</p><p align=left>

The door to the bathing room opened and Akon and a couple of the tub fillers
came in. One of the women said "Don't like your bathing woman, we can get you
another, she said you'd prefer her." I let out a huge sigh. Akon came to my
defense. "This woman is not his wash woman, he doesn't even like her. She's
an...." his voice paused as she turned her naked body towards him and then she
tried to cover her private areas that she was so freely showing me. "...she's a
priestess of a thieving Power, and shouldn't even be here..." Nice to see Akon
is moved by her form, and while nice, he's seemed to be above such things as
physical attraction. The women covered her up with a white robe, and proceeded
to remove her from the bathing chamber. I let out a huge sigh of relief, even
larger due to the fact that this fiasco hadn't summoned Lady Christine. I put
on my leathers, and asked Akon "Where is the armorer, I would like to repair
some of the damage to my armor before I go before factol Ambar. Oh and thank
you by the way. As evil as she is, I would be lying if I said she wasn't
desirable."</p><p align=left>

Akon grinned. "I understand completely, maybe if you allowed your lust to run
away with her, she would leave us alone, and you could pursue Lady Christine."
The life from me face drained as cold fear set in. Was I that obvious?  I
babbled "What do you mean... how.. did... you.. know." Akon's smile parted even
wider. "I'm a mage, and I also know well the looks you gave the good lady." I
let out a sigh "and most men would have copulated with that witch, even knowing
how she is, unless they had their heart set on someone else. Wise choice,
Christine is a good woman." I bit my lip in embarrassment and I breathed out
"What do you know about her?" Akon smirked "I know she's available, and I know
she is very picky. By the Powers, she wasn't even interested in me!" I smiled,
Akon was a strong man, I could see that he'd be the type to have attention.
Akon poke again "Well Bane, let's go to the Armorer, and we will talk about
Lady Christine."</p><p align=left>

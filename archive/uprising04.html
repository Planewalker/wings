Arctur flopped upon his bed and stared at the ceiling.  Even though he was
almost positive that no one saw him in front of the Courts, he was still
worried.  There were hundreds of people, and all it would take was one
blabbermouth berk to expose him.<p>
However, he had gotten the information he needed.  His henchmen managed to play
the part of Anarchist informants.  He also knew the identity of the man all
along.  He fooled him blind so that he would know that he, Arctur Bonifest,
would be the next factol of the Harmonium.  And to boot, he had his henchmen
order him to plant to bomb in the Courts so it would look like he was under
fire from someone.<p>
At this point all was according to plan.  In less than a week, he estimated, he
would have the entire city in his grip.  He had always thought people were easy
to fool, and this was the proof.  He was so full of himself, he could barely
fit in the room.<p>
Then something entered his mind.  He had forgotten a part of his plan, the most
vital part.  He jumped up from the bed and to the cabinets.  He began to browse
through them wildly, mumbling to himself.  After turning his cabinet to
shambles, he pulled out a small pin.<p>
He stuffed the pin into his pocket and walked into the empty hallway.  He crept
slowly along, making sure no one heard him.  He managed to almost get to the
roof, when he heard a voice behind him:  "Arctur!"<p>
He spun around to see Lt. Barbithka standing behind him.  His heart jumped and
his body almost went with it.  He stammered trying to look for words.
"L..l..l..lieutenant!  H, hello sir.  How are you tonight?"<p>
Barbithka raised his eyebrow and looked at him oddly.  "Are you all right
Arctur, you seem a little pale."<p>
Arctur's face suddenly blushed with heat.  "Yes sir.  Just&#133;.going to the
roof for&#133;some fresh air.  Yeah"<p>
"Are you sure you are all right?"<p>
Arctur nodded nervously.  Barbithka turned around to leave, and bid him
goodnight over his shoulder.  Arctur tried to conceal the pin he had tucked in
his pocket.  Barbithka turned around one more time to look back at him then
went on about his way.<p>
Arctur fell against a wall and panted.  He just barely managed to escape being
caught by The Lieutenant, and then he would have been doomed for sure.  But no
matter.  He did escape, and he had to hurry before someone else found him.<p>
He silently crept up a narrow flight up stairs that led to the roof.  After
getting to the top, he looked around.  The night-lights of the city were
glowing.  It was an usually clear night.  He could see the Civic Festhall from
here.  It really is a sight to see Sigil at night.  The lights rising into the
sky on both sides and above.  Arctur shook his head falling back out of his
trance.  He would have time to look later.<p>
He walked along the walls for a time, wondering where it was.  After a minute,
he smelt the stench of death.  He knew he was getting close.  He kept looking
on all sides, and while he wasn't looking, he ran into something rather awful.
He stepped back for a moment to look at it.  It was a partially decayed
humanoid figure, maybe a month old.  Bit of flesh were still on it's skull,
being eaten my maggots.  It was Sarin's assassin.<p>
Arctur took the small pin form his pocket and looked for a piece of cloth that
was still on the body.  He probed the body disdainfully, getting dead skin and
meat all over his hands.  He had to use all his strength not to vomit.  His
hand finally found something that resembled a pocket, and he quickly stuffed
the pin inside.<p>
He stumbled away from the dead thing and fell to his knees.  He closed his eyes
and felt sick to his stomach.  It wasn't just the sight of the decayed body
that bothered him, but the horrid sight caused a vision in his head.  A vision
that, thought he could not recognize it, was simply dark, horrid and
evil&#133;<p>
First, came the sight of a dark room.  His vision was blurred at first, but
then cleared.  There were 5 men in clerical robes, though it was not holy.
There was a dark thing about it.  He could hear noises of fighting and
bloodshed, though there was none going on in the room, from what he could
see.<p>
In the front of the room stood a long altar, seemingly made of something that
looked like a cross between smoky quartz and obsidian.  Draped over it were
pieces of black clothes with strange runes woven into them.  At the bottom was
what had to be a legend of some sort.  It was written in an ancient and
indecipherable tongue.  On the cloth were three items.  A rapier with an odd
looking pommel that resembled a bearded man with horns, a glowing piece of
crystal that seems to heavily radiate strong magic on an unknown type, and he
gave a mental gasp at the third item.<p>
It was a gold and platinum trimmed plaque.  On it was engraved a ring broken by
three circles.  Inside the ring was a strange starburst.  Three smaller circles
broke the ring itself with small sigils engraved in them.  His vision
involuntarily zoomed in on them.  Inside each of the circles was the sigils of
three factions: that of the Fraternity of Order, the Mercykillers, and the
Harmonium.<p>
Suddenly a rift appeared over the altar and dark black, swirling clouds came
forth.  The three items were taken into the rift and tumbled through the dark
clouds.  The sword first glowed with an eerie light, then the light faded into
the clouds in a stream of energy.  The sword then began to shake violently and
suddenly shattered, the pieces scattered about the cloud.  The crystal glowed
with a deep blue light, which also was sucked into the cloud and swirled about.
And then the plaque was raised up to the top of the cloud, and it suddenly
began shifting into the shape of a crown.<p>
After the plaque was transformed, the swirling energies began to join in the
center of the clouds, being collected by the crystal.  Then the shattered
pieces of the sword began to mold around the crystal, covering it with melted
steel and gold.<p>
Then the most horrifying part of all came.  The mass in the center began to
expand into a shape.  It continued expanding until the form resembled a
humanoid shape.  The crown then floated down to what had to be the head of the
thing.  As soon as it came down upon its head, it took a solid shape.<p>
The shape was truly horrid.  It was a decaying, filthy thing, covered in
tattered clothes and a rotting cape.  It was withered and old, with a laugh
that pierced at Arctur's very soul.  Then the thing opened its eyes, and he
found that one was missing.  The remaining eye, which seemed yellow and catlike
in nature, seemed to stare right at Arctur, and an evil grin came across its
face&#133;<p>
Then Arctur's vision vanished like a bad dream.  He opened his eyes at looked
around at the city lights.  He looked up and saw the Civic Festhall staring
right back at him.  He fell over and gasped for air.  What he saw had to have
been his conscience at work, trying to stop him from completing his plan.  But
it was too late now.  He was in far too deep to admit what he has done.  What
could happen anyway?  His plan was perfect.  Nothing could go wrong.<p>
He stood up and walked back over to the stairs.  Nothing would go wrong, he
assured himself.  Nothing.<p>

The day had arrived.  From up on the roof, Arctur could see people dancing in
the streets for joy.  After nearly 3 weeks of chaos all over the city, order
would finally be restored.  He looked back at the council atop the roof.  The
Lieutenant, along with his advisors and the Factols Hashkar and Mallin and his
daughter, Kelsia were all there.  Kelsia was young, about 16, and very
sprightly for her age.  She had this beaming smile, but somehow it showed that
it was forced.  The chant was she isn't very big on politics, but she is forced
into the thick of it because her father is a factol.<p>
Seeing no other seats, Arctur casually sat in the chair next to Kelsia.  He
gave her a brief smile and put his face in his hands, the memory of his vision
still firmly planted in his mind.  Kelsia looked at him in a concerned fashion.
"Are you ok?" she said.<p>
"I'm, I'm just fine, thanks." Arctur mumbled.  Mallin looked over at him
quickly then went back to looking over the crowd.<p>
Kelsia narrowed her eyes at him. "No you're not.  You're lying," she said.  He
sighed, remembering the annoying power the Red Death has, that detect lie
thing. <p>
He grumbled and said, "I am just a little nervous.  It's the big moment, after
all.  We are standing on the brink on a new era.   All that's left to do is
jump in and enjoy it, if you want to."<p>
Kelsia looked at him oddly, "Do you know something I don't?" she asked
quizzically.<p>
"All will be made known in short order, dear.  Just sit back, and watch the
show."<p>
The cheering ceaselessly continued from the crowd below. A sea of humanity, or
whatever other life forms also, left Arctur gazing at them.  He knew that soon,
he would change all of their lives, forever.  They couldn't comprehend how
things would change, how he would change things.<p>
Moments later, the electoral council chairman approached the pedestal.  It took
him a minute or two in order to silence the masses before him, but when they
finally got silent, the excitement in his voice was plain to everyone.<p>
"Fellow citizens of The City of Doors," he started, "this day shall be rejoiced
for many a year to come.  For today, we shall anoint the new leader of the
Harmonium faction, and shall be appointed to the office of Captain of the
Guard.<p>
"Ever since Sarin's death 3 weeks ago, everyone in the Harmonium was deeply
saddened by the tragic murder of our former great factol.  The electoral
council could barely function, we were so grief stricken.  But now, our work is
done.  We have considered all the options, and have made the decision that
would produce the highest mutual benefit for all Cagers.  We have chosen a new
leader that will carry the torch, lit by our Great Founder and received from
Sarin, on to the great Golden Age of peace and harmony.<p>
"But now, the moment is upon us, fellow citizens.  It is time to restore order
back to our great city, and we firmly believe we have chosen the man who will
do it.  Ladies and Gentlemen of Sigil, I present to you at this time, the new
Factol of the Harmonium&#133;&#133;<p>
"Lieutenant Captain Barbithka!"<p>
The cheering came in almost like the rush of a tidal wave as everyone on the
roof gasped aloud; except Barbithka, who was so filled with excitement he
couldn't speak, and Arctur, who concealed a devilish smile with his hand.<p>
"Approach the stand, Barbithka," commanded the chairman.<p>
Barbithka stood up slowly.  He was visibly shaking from excitement.  He took
very slow and gaunt steps toward the podium.  As he walked, he looked over the
cheering mass.  He stopped for a moment, smiled nervously and waved.  He was so
overwhelmed, the he continued to smile and wave wildly for several minutes.
Then the councilman got tired of waiting, and dragged him over to the podium.
Barbithka didn't look away from the crowd for a second.  His gaze was seemingly
locked on the people below.<p>
The chairman produced a large book from his robe and held it in his left hand,
while raising his right.  Barbithka's hand continued to wave.  The chairman
slapped him in the side of the head to try to awake him.  He placed his left
hand on the book, and raised his right, trying to hide a gigantic smile.<p>
"Lt. Barbithka," began the chairman, "will you willfully and to the best of
your ability, serve and defend the people of Sigil, the City of Doors; all laws
and regulations set forth by the government of Sigil, the City of Doors; and
the values and morals set forth in the tome of The Harmonium Law?<p>
Trying not to shout, Barbithka replied in a small tone of voice, "I do."<p>
"If any man has just cause as to why this man shall not be the Captain of the
Guard, let him speak now, or he shall forever hold his piece."<p>
A silence befell the crowd.  But suddenly, Arctur stood and proclaimed loudly,
"I have just cause as to why he should not be the Captain of the Guard: This
man constructed and executed willingly and maliciously, a scheme to muscle his
way into power, which included scheming the murder of Factol Sarin, and have
the evidence to prove as such."<p>
Everyone froze in place, if not in time.

The dock here was unstable, but I was able to get off the boat and to the shore before possibly tripping into 
the memory sapping waters of the Styx. I look around and I don't see anything that could be a gate. I yell 
to the boatsman "Where is the gate?" He pointed a bony hand to the sky. I noticed that we were close to 
being between layers of this place and a town was above me through the outer layer. "How am I supposed 
to get up there?" The fiend grinned and gave a mocking shrug. "You fucking bastard!"  The fiend waved 
and his skiff went off. Betrayed by a fiend. well at least he didn't send me to the Arcanoloth Tower on 
right to that Orange fiend who is chasing after me. All I need to do is find a way up. I pull Derra out, my 
lovely bastard sword. "Derra? Is there a way to transverse to the upper plane?" Derra replied sultry "Yes 
Bane, there are balloons on Carceri, said to be made of human flesh, but you can ride one up to the next 
layer." I ask her "Well where do I get one?" Derra replies "I don't know, I never had to use one." I say 
"Well I guess we will have to find and buy one. wha."

A sword struck me in the back. It bowled me forward. My Baatorian chain mail held firm, but it sure 
stung. I turn around and there is a bestial warrior standing over me. He thrusts his sword down at me, I 
roll out of the way. I swing Derra and put up my Black Rose shield. Our weapons clashed and we spar 
some more. I have no idea who this guy is. He's a priest of Malar. He must have been hunting you. He's 
good, even I didn't detect him. My sword finally cleaves his side, and he howls in pain. He furiously 
batters at me with his sword, so fast that I could barely see his sword hit me. I kept my cool, as he hasn't 
done too serious of damage as the chain mail held. I slammed Derra into his neck. Blood shot out as he 
screeched in pain. He struck at me again, even as more blood poured out. Ick, this blood stuff is getting 
old. This guy was a great fighter, but I finally saw a flaw in his combat technique. I thrust past his 
defenses and slammed my sword into his chest. He struggled a bit, and even struck at me with his sword, 
my shield stopped it. He flailed around until he could no longer live, and his body slumpt.
</p><p align=left>
I pulled Derra out of the Priest's body. The priest leaped up. His body with gushing wounds that started to 
close. What did I get myself into? The priest roared at me. He seemed more bestial than man. He threw 
down his sword and scrambled off. "What the?" Derra answered my silent question. "Maybe it was a test 
by Malar, and he left in failure. I think he blew it in another case. Most priests of Malar use the Claws of 
Malar, and he didn't." I smiled grimly. I wasn't too amused being splattered with more blood. "I'm sick 
of being hunted." I hear someone call "Bane?" I turn to see Lady Christine, armour clad in grey chain 
mail and carrying a round shield. I rush over to her. I bow before her and take her hands, she flinched 
slightly, but relaxed when I kissed them. "My lady, why are you out here alone?" Her brilliant smile came 
across. "I came to find you. I found out in Sigil that you escaped the Prison to Carceri, and I came to find 
you."  How did she get here by herself? "Where is Akon and Chandeen?" Christine gave a sad face, 
which made me want to weep. "Akon was killed by the evil priest and that gensai. The one who likes 
you." I blushed because I didn't realize she knew about Shara and her um obsession with me. "What about 
Chandeen?" She smiled in reply. "He's fine. He's up in The Bastion of Last Hope, a city on the first layer 
of Carceri. I looked up and pointed. "That city there?" She replied "Why yes, I know of a gate that could 
get us up there. Come with me." She took me with her soft hand and led us across the land. The earth 
here was soft and dank, like a marsh. It looked like it was getting worse too, but I could see a city in the 
distance that would seem to tell me that was where we were heading.
</p><p align=left>
As we got closer, I could see that the sickly looking trees in this swampy area holds the city and long 
bridges made of rope and wood planks are the only passage to another area of the town. "The swamps 
there are very deep, so we best not anger any of the residents of the town." I reply "How do you know 
about this?" The sweet lady replied "While looking for you in Carceri, has led me here. We  have been 
checking towns to see if anyone seen you and we paid a Yugoloth to drop you off here." Hmm that 
explains why I landed here.  We continued to walk, but I thought about something. "My lady, I haven't 
mentioned this, but you look absolutely stunning. I missed you incredibly through my trials and 
tribulations of Gehenna and Carceri." The lady smiled "I was wondering when you would say something. 
I would kiss you, but you are still covered in dried blood". Blah! I forgot about it. I was so excited about 
her return, I had forgotten what an awful mess I am. "I apologize my lady. It's been a rough road for me." 
Again she replies sweetly "I understand, we may be able to clean you up in town." 
</p><p align=left>
We continued to walk, and Christine wasn't very talkative, but that may be best here. Too much sound 
may attract the locals, and if she's been here for any period of time, she knows this. So I stayed silent. We 
found a ramp that led into town. The trees here are large, but they are black and devoid of leaves, so they 
look haunting, and most of the buildings are made of the same stuff. This city looks like a warped version 
of an wood elven village. Wait? How would I know what a wood elven village looks like? I must have been 
to one before I lost my memory.  There is a ramp leading up to a guard station. The guard looked like he 
was going to accost us but saw the Lady and stopped from doing so. I wonder if it's because she's so 
beautiful or she used some sort of influence on him?  I knew that the Power she worships is a very 
secretive deity and doesn't live in the Outer Planes, so she may have some power here. 
</p><p align=left>
The bridge wasn't too sturdy, so I was going to walk across first, but Lady Christine insisted, she went 
across, and the bridge creaked a little. It was strange, she had told me that she hadn't been out to any of 
the Outer Planes yet, she was raised in the Outlands, and spent her adulthood in Sigil. For that she doesn't 
seem to set aback from being in such a dark, dreary, evil spot. I walked across. She smiled as I walked 
across. She's such a wonderful woman. Christine's face softened almost like she could read my thoughts, 
but she stepped back to allow me to step onto the island. Most of the people looked at us suspiciously and 
jealously. I don't think it's because I'm with an incredible woman. My impression is Carceri is a prison, 
and they are jealous of anyone who might possess the ability to escape.
</p><p align=left>
We went into a building that actually rose several stories. The entrance looked bizarre, it was jagged 
leaning right, like an evil mouth with ugly pointed teeth. She went in and talked to the barkeep. She must 
be staying at this inn, because he did know her. She came over to me. "I got a room with a bath, it cost a 
lot of gold, but I want to see you clean again. She put a key in my hand. "It is the penthouse room, 
apparently this inn has a link to the Plane of Water which is how they get it. To activate the water, put the 
key over the portal." I smile. "I can pay for the room, I have the.." Then she shushed me and whispered 
"Don't talk about how much gold you have here. I know you plundered well in the Lower Planes, but they 
don't need to know that." I felt like I was being scolded, and she noticed the sad look. "I know you would, 
I know you are a very generous man. I know you can make it up to me." She smiled ruefully.  Her hand 
brushed by my behind, my chainmail is normally there, but she managed to reach under it to pat my 
behind. I blushed. I certainly didn't expect that from her. She laughed playfully.  I bowed to her and 
walked my way up to the room.
</p><p align=left>
The "penthouse" was not penthouse sized, it was a 20x20 room with a hard bed and a bathtub with what 
looks to be a small portal above it. I stripped out of my armor and clothes and used the key on the portal. 
Water started to pour into the tub. I stepped back and watched the water fill the tub. It got to 3 quarters 
full and the water stopped, the portal closed. The water was very clear. I wasn't very bloody with my 
clothes off, but I still needed to get clean. I got into the tub; the water wasn't too cold or too hot. I cleansed 
myself as well as possible and lay there in the tub. How odd Lady Christine has been acting? What could it 
be? I got out of the tub. Where does the water drain to? Suddenly as soon as I got out of the tub a hole 
opened at the bottom and the water drained away. When the tub was empty I could see that it was a gate. 
On the other side was ooze. Must be to the plane of quasi-elemental ooze. Very interesting.
</p><p align=left>
I activated the key again and water rushed into the tub, both portals are much too small to escape Carceri, 
but the people in this berg are using this as an interesting type of plumbing. I used the second tub of water 
to wash the armor and remove the blood from my clothes and leather armor. Once the dirt and blood filled 
the tub, it drained into the plane of ooze. I don't think I'd want to go there if I could go there.
</p><p align=left>
I put the wet clothes on. Fortunately, they weren't too wet. Then the leather armour and my green steel 
chain mail. Derra was surprisingly quiet. I forgot that I left her in the scabbard. I pulled her out. "What's 
going on Bane? You left me in the scabbard all day, that's not like you." I replied "Sorry Derra, I just 
haven't had combat for a little while. I apologize, but I found Lady Christine." Derra replied "Well that is 
good, I mean if I couldn't have you, she will do. At least we get to fight together." I smiled "And I'm sure 
here in Carceri we'll have more fiends to fight."  Derra replied "Most assuredly, but Bane, let me ask you. 
If I was still a mortal woman." I answered before she could finish her sentence. "There would be some 
hard contest for my affections, but considering my track record I'd get lost again, trapped in Limbo or 
something, and both of you would fight to find me first." Derra giggled "Where oh where could Bane be? 
Is he in Baator, the Abyss, or what nasty place has he gotten stuck in now?"
</p><p align=left>
We both laughed and suddenly the door burst open. It was Lady Christine. I never saw her do a feat of 
strength like that before. "Who's in here with you!?!?" she shrieked. I mildly replied "My lady, you have 
met my intelligent sword Derra. When we first met." Her beautiful brow, which was stern and cross, 
softened. "I'm sorry, of course, I just thought a Succubus was in here, or some other trollop trying to 
capture your affections." I smiled and said "I could love no one more than you, my lady." I took her 
delicate hand and kissed it. She giggled a little, but then pulled her hand away. "What's wrong my lady?" 
She shook her head and closed the door. "Nothing my darling, I just want to give you something."

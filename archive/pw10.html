The blood warrior seemed quite smitten with Lady Christine. He was
endlessly rattling his bonebox with questions about her. I didn't have the
heart to tell him that the good lady was very selective with the suitors she
chose. In fact, no bold cutter has managed to impress Lady Christine to even
receive a kiss from her, or a second meeting. Of course, there is something
different about Bane. His mannerisms are strange, but he is a prime, but his
time in Baator has toughened him. I can only imagine what torment he had gone
through. He refused to have the Armorer work on his armor. He didn't claim to
forge it. In fact, he told me that Baatezu forged it. He knew how to repair it,
but he didn't know how or where. Poor berk's amnesia is getting to him. Once he
fixed the armor, he put on his padding, then placed the glimmering chain mail
on. While it definitely looks like the green steel the Baatezu make, it doesn't
have the foul markings that most Baatezu armor would have. Indeed, he was
unique. </p><p align=left>

The cutter walked with grace and confidence as we went before Factol Ambar,
little did he know who else would be in attendance. Shara was ejected from the
factorium, for that we were both grateful. I think Bane was afraid with that
sea-bitch on him, that Lady Christine would think she was his. Admittedly it'd
be difficult as it is to win her over, but with Shara around, it would be
impossible. We came to the doors leading into the chamber, Bane strode forward
with confidence. He was a handsome mortal now that he was clean, his hair dark
and long, touching his shoulders. His eyes were dark green, like a forest, and
his build was strong and lean. His chain mail glimmered, and his sword reached
just an inch from the floor.  </p><p align=left>

The doors opened for us into the Godsman chamber. Factol Ambar was talking with
another factor and saw Bane and I walk in. Bane's eyes were actually on Lady
Christine, who he immediately noted was in the room. When she looked at him,
she didn't recognize him as the crusty blood caked warrior she saw before.
Their eyes met briefly and she blushed and turned away. Bane seemed a bit less
confident than he did. I think he wanted to approach the lady, but he decided
to approach Ambar instead. We walked over to the factol, he had elven blood in
his veins, but he is half human as well, he greeted us. "Akon, greetings, and I
assume that this is the Blood Warrior named Bane." He shook Bane's hand. Bane
acknowledged him, and tried to smile, but he was definitely nervous, but not of
Ambar. "Akon returned the Godsman amulet to us, but he said you were
instrumental in getting this for us. I thank you for that, and keeping Akon in
one piece, he can get himself into trouble." Ambar and I grinned, and Bane let
a relaxed smile. Ambar noticed his reservedness "What seems to be bothering you
Bane?" I smiled as Bane tried to stumble out an excuse. "I think Bane would
like to be introduced to Lady Christine."</p><p align=left>

Ambar smiled in realization, he did notice that Bane did look a number of times
her way. I don't believe Christine recognized him, but she did smile his way,
and he smiled back. Ambar called to her. "Christine, my dear, come over here."
The lady walked over and smiled. "Greetings Factol Ambar, Akon, and you are..."
referring to Bane. Bane replied "Bane. Pleased to meet you." He took her hand
like it was delicate china. Christine's eyes lighted up with recognition. "Oh
yes, you were all bloody and needed a bath. You must be an excellent warrior,
none of that blood seemed to be yours."  Bane smiled and a bit of red came to
his cheeks. His hand was still clasped to hers, she looked down to her hand and
she smiled. He quickly released her hand. "Well I did get wounded, but I have
an excellent healer." She smiled "Oh really? Who is she?" I almost believe I
heard some jealousy in her voice. Bane patted his pommel of his intelligent
sword. "Derra is my sword, and she has the power to heal me."</p><p align=left>

Christine replied "Really? Why do you call her a she?" Bane replied "Well she
can tell you." He drew his sword. Everyone thought he may attack and Christine
seemed a little nervous. "Derra, this is Lady Christine." Derra's deep voice
spoke "Greetings Lady Christine, I protect Bane when he's in battle." Christine
answered "Oh a intelligent sword! Where did you get it?" Bane sheathed his
sword and replied "Got it after nearly being killed by it. I was fighting a
Marquis Cambion and he wielded her, We gave each other a killing blow, but they
pulled Derra out and put her in my hands and used her powers to heal me." I
didn't realize that was how he got the sword, a Marquis Cambion is one of the
most powerful half-tanar'ri fiends and he won in combat, but I guess after
defeating the red dragon on the Gray Waste, I can believe it. The Lady seemed
impressed. "So why did she want to save you, besides the obvious." She gave a
devious smile that I never seen on her before. Maybe the warrior has a chance.
Bane noted her flirt, and he replied "Her and I have the same beliefs, and the
same hatred of fiends, so when she could, she saved me. If I hadn't drove my
silver sword into the fiend, killing him, I wouldn't have survived." Her eyes
glittered with confusion, she really has never met a fiend slayer before. I
have killed fiends, but he has killed major fiends, a Maralith, a Marquis
Cambion and a Dragon. "I have something for you." Bane said. She looked
expectantly as he drew out two large sapphires  larger than eyes. I believe he
got these from the dragon.  Christine's eyes opened wide as he placed them in
her hands. "These are for you.  These sapphires remind me of your eyes, but
they aren't nearly as beautiful."  That really got to her. Her smile was as
broad as it could get. "I hope I can see you again?" He asked. The Lady replied
"Absolutely, thank you, these are beautiful." The lady came forward, put her
arms around the warrior and kissed him.</p><p align=left>

Amazing! I've never seen her kiss anyone, but they were planted softly against
his lips, for a not so brief kiss. When their lips parted, Bane spoke "Where
can I see you?" Christine replied "I've been invited to the Sensate ball, would
you like to go with me?" Bane replied "Dance? I think I like to dance,
especially if it'd be with you. When is it?"  Ambar and I were just struck at
how easily he won her over. She is incredibly kind, but never has a man so
easily won her over. "Tomorrow night, if you aren't busy?" Like he would say
no. "Absolutely, what should I wear?" Christine replied "Some regular attire,
you won't need to be slaying fiends there." Bane started to walk away, but then
quickly took her hand and kissed it. "Only wooing hearts." Christine's face
turned bright red, as Bane released her hand and walked away. I think he has
done what no one else could do. Maybe she can persuade him to the Godsmen, he
would be a great edition to the order. I mentioned this to Factol Ambar, and he
had to agree.</p><p align=left>

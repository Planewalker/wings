Where am I? Who am I? I am holding on for dear life. My hands were
gripping onto an orange scaled dragon. Dragon?!? There aren't any dragons in my
world, or were there? I don't remember. I don't remember anything, nothing
seems right. I look below and I see lakes of fire and writhing souls burning.
Did I go to hell? Is this dragon actually a demon from hell bringing my soul to
burn with the rest of the damned? I do recall when someone leads a sinful life,
you go to hell, but I can't remember where I learned it. Wait, there is a word
for my condition, but if I had amnesia, why would I be in hell? Pain struck
thorough my body. When you are dead, you aren't supposed to feel physical pain
are we? Maybe I was misinformed, or maybe when you die, you get sent to a
different reality, depending on the kind of life you lead. I'm not sure what to
believe. What? I'm falling.................. the demon dropped me, and he's
laughing at me. I'm going to die....................

"WAKE UP YOU DIRTBAGS!" I jump out of bed. I am in a big Barracks like chamber,
with a number of cots and a number of other people jumping out too. But these
people look extremely different from me. Some looked human like me, but others
look human. Something was different, like one have cloven hooves, and one had
reddish skin and a tail. Most of these creatures had some sort of demon-like
features. What are these creatures? "ATTENTION! You filthy piece of lemure
waste! Get your armor from out of your lockers and get ready to march! Move it!
Move it! move it!" I came over to a large locker, and I opened it. Sure enough
a fiendish looking set of chain mail set inside. I wasn't wearing anything
other than a loincloth. There didn't seem to be any padding, or leather
underneath. I looked around, and all the humans, and semi-humans were putting
on their chain mail without it. I grabbed the breastplate, and added the chain
coif and strapped on the chain arm and leg guards. My pausing caused me to be
the last one out of the barracks.

The sky was blood red, and I might be wrong, but I think I saw fireballs
exploding in the air. I've never seen anything like this in my life, not that I
could remember anyway. There wasn't a "sun" so to speak, like that gray plane I
was stuck on, where I spent a couple days running from evil spirits moaning in
terror and then fought those little gargoyle creatures. The landscape here was
mostly red, either from the coloring of the land, to the exploding balls of
fire in the air, and burning bodies of tortured souls. I remember seeing my
sword in there, but no one else wore a weapon, so I kept it in the locker. The
'drill sergeant' was a huge black dragon-like demon. The rows of human and
human-like beings left a spot open in the front. The demon looked angry. "Move
it, you larva slime!" I ran as fast as I could in 35 pounds of armor. The black
creature marched over to me. "You worthless slime!" The Huge sergeant lifted me
up. "You are by the Powers, the most barmy berk I have ever seen!" He threw me
twenty feet with a crash, by the time I got my bearings. the huge demon was
over me. "Bane, you are going to be my special case. You must think you are a
great cutter because the Commander thinks you can fight. Well you aren't! You
are a worthless berk!" My ribs have healed, so I wasn't too hurt. I got up and
smashed the creature in the face. His scaled hide shielded him from the blow,
and it doesn't seem that I could possibly hurt him.. The beast let a foul grin.
"Is that the best you got?"  The sergeant stood over me, and I backed up and
crashed into the sergeant. The force I exerted was enough to make us tumble.
The large beast fell, but he quickly threw me off of him.
</p><p align=left>
I landed with a crash. "You are spoiling, boy! I don't need a chaotic fool like
you in the ranks. I will get rid of you legally. A duel!" I looked at the
demon, I was surprised, I figured he would just attack me and try to kill me.
He spoke " So accept if you think you are such a bold cutter." I stood up. "I
accept your challenge Demon!" The Black creature laughed "A prime berk, only a
prime berk would call me 'demon', and only a berk would challenge a Black
Abashai. But no more dallying, our challenge will be tonight, but right now, we
march!" I knew how the military was, and that there was a right time for a
fight. Was I in the military before? Was I in this military? Our formation
marched off on the burning plane.
</p><p align=left>
The large beast had us run for miles and miles. When some of the others lagged
behind, a huge fireball from nowhere would blast the poor berk. Berk? What is
that term? Other than how it's used, I have no idea where it came from, and
what is a Prime? I suppose I wasn't meant to be here, else I would know what
they mean. Most people who have amnesia can remember what they learned, like I
am, but just can't recall where or when they learned it. I guess that theory
was true, in my case. I must have been used to running, because it didn't
bother me one bit, I kept the front rank going. The Abashai, as he called
himself, saw this and ran us harder, more of the back ranks fell, but the
hardiest of the group kept up, but the laggers got blasted. The Abashai
couldn't run faster, he lifted his blackened wings and flew ahead of us and
shrieked "MOVE IT YOU BERKS! RUN LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!" I started
running as fast as I could, and I broke away from the pack, seems that the
others couldn't run this far and then go to full speed, because I wasn't
running exceptionally fast, but I was running nearly under the drill sergeant,
much to his chagrin.
</p><p align=left>
The blackened plane has blasting fireballs in the sky, and of course, would
blast the poor berks that couldn't keep up. This land seems so chaotic. In the
distance I could see rivers, one of fire, and the other looked red, and if it's
as it smells, it must be blood. Odd looking structures loomed off the way as
well. One looked like a number of round objects stacked upon each other, but
they didn't seem stone-like, in fact, I could swear that they were moving.
Another looked like a wall of bone surrounding a large fortress in the
distance, that actually looked like a giant guardian demon, only the fact that
it never moved, and that there were openings where the other demons would fly
into made me believe it was a structure, and not an actual demon. Some were
like the Sergeant, except they seem to have 3 distinctive colors: Red, Green,
and Black. Also there were these smaller green demons with feathery wings
instead of scaly wings flying around as well.
</p><p align=left>
Our barracks was about a mile away from the fortress. Out of the fifty that
went out on the dark plane, only twenty of us returned. Ten of us were human,
but they were meaner than I think I am. The other, were these humans that had
bestial parts, one didn't even have parts like the others, there just wasn't
something right about him, all these seemed quite angry at me for angering the
sergeant, but they were too exhausted to let me know with more than a look.
</p><p align=left>
We piled into a mess hall, and their the chef was serving something foul, he
slopped the food on a tray and pushed it to me. I looked at it and realized
what it was...human flesh. My stomach started to turn, and bile tried to force
it's way up my throat. I believe I would have lost what was in my stomach, but
I had nothing in it, I don't even remember eating, but I certainly know that it
isn't this. The others in the troop didn't have a problem with it and were
eating hungrily. My stomach nearly leapt out of my throat as it turned,
verifying that there was no food, no water whatsoever that could be in my
stomach. I guess the others felt they have no choice, but some liked it. A
different Abashai looked at me and snarled. "What's a matter, food not
palatable? Are you one of those sissy berks?" I snarled back "I am no cannibal,
I want real food." The Abashai brought up a claw to slash at me, but another
Abashai, a red one, spoke to him. "No, he has a challenge, and he needs food.
He fights Grazlen." The other Abashai seemed to make a smile. He pulled out a
plate and it looked like a cooked boar, very large and oddly shaped, but it was
definitely boar. "Good luck tonight mortal, Devtel and I put some jink on you.
Lose and we will chew your lemure body." I nodded. Lemure body? What is a Lemure?
</p><p align=left>
I sat down and greedily ate the boar. My stomach buzzed with pleasure, it had
to be the best food I ever had in my life. I felt strong, like I could take on
the world. The soldiers in my platoon were even more furious about my
preferential treatment. The sergeant tore greedily into a human arm, lapping up
the blood that still issued from it. I looked at him and I gave him a deathly
stare. The fiend grinned at me, like he thought for sure he would win, the
victims blood dribbled from his fiendish mouth. I just hope that it's honorable
combat, where I have a weapon that can kill him, else all the food in the world
wouldn't make me strong enough to kill the beast.
</p><p align=left>
After our meal, a red, spiky looking demon marched the troop away, another one
marched me to an arena that was off to the west, if there are any directions in
this place, of the barracks, and the mess hall. it wasn't a building we saw
when we were running. Torches were lit, and they were actually white souls
twisted into a torch form, with their hair on fire. It was hideous, the poor
souls were twisted, and by the looks were still alive. Sickening moans issued
out these torches, even after seeing all I have seen so far, this was still
unsettling. The demon led me into a chamber which was something like a
preparation room. I didn't have any armor, but my silver sword was here. The
Spiky demon was about to leave. "What no armor?" He turned to me and grinned.
"No Armor!" The demon left cackling, like I told him a joke. That big black
demons body has scales like armor, my sword is my only hope.. I hefted the
blade, The five foot blade balanced well in my hands, it looked like a sharp
blade, it may cleave those scales. If only......"Get going!" The spiked fiend
was back. I put the long blade in my right hand, and walked on my way up for
the fight of my life.

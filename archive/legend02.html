The steady drip of water falling in to the sewer felt soothing to the
 scholar who sat hunched against the tunnel wall scribbling on parchment.
 Drip, drip; the water fell like grains of sand passing through the center of
 an hourglass. Hour after hour of walking through the partially flooded
 tunnels failed to reveal any new chambers or passages and the small scholar
 came to the realization that he was inside some kind of maze. Only the
 steady drip of water provided any means of experiencing the passage of time.
 The scholar had ceased to be offended by the smell of his surroundings long
 ago, now all his concentration was focused on capturing the designs that so
 long haunted his dreams.

 The knight stood defiantly in the street, steadfast against the dark
 apparition that was coming straight towards him. His blood sang with courage
 and his mind was filled with visions of glory. So light were his thoughts
 that he felt that he could take flight at any moment to join one of the
 shining heavenly hosts. He raised the potion of invulnerability to his lips
 and hoped that his blurry vision would clear up swiftly. But his limbs
 refused to obey him and his potion fell to the ground, its contents spilled
 amongst the shards of glass. A sense of déjà vu overcame the bubber as mind
 unwillingly sobered up. Gone were the dreams of past glory, swept away by
 the menace of the approaching figure. The former knight slumped down between
 the piles of refuse in the alley and for the first time in years his heart
 ached for another. When the figure had passed the former knight uttered a
 prayer: "Please Lord, let me never again see another fallen servant."

 The tenement in this part of the Hive should have collapsed long ago, but
 the Dabus made repairs to it recently. Graffiti covered most of the outer
 walls including anarchist slogans and rants. However, one word had painted
 over them all recently. That word had begun to appear in various places
 around the Cage. In all the wards except for the Hive, that word was quickly
 painted over or covered up. But here amongst the desperate and poor, the
 word stood out like a beacon of hope and promise. LEGEND.

 The spy sat like a clueless sod staring at the newcomers who had just
 entered the tavern. At first he had thought that more Hezrou had come to
 join others of their race. But the tattoos on the foreheads of the new
 comers and the differing colors of their skins revealed them to be Slaadi.
 A loud click nearby caught the spy's attention and he realized that he had
 just closed his gawking bone-box. It took several minutes to calm his nerves
 and exert his will in order to prevent him from running out of the tavern.
 But the spy prided himself on his discipline and cool. Sitting in a tavern
 with a group of Hezrou as well as a group of red, green and blue Slaadi was
 a challenge that the spy felt that he could manage for a few hours more.
 Amazingly his desire to cough had gone away.

 The librarian raised an eyebrow in surprise when he saw the woman enter the
 room. Despite the fact that he had worked with this scribe on numerous
 projects, she never ceased to amaze him. It was just a shame that she
 happened to be a tiefling. Shrugging aside these thoughts, the librarian
 instructed the woman on how to go about cataloguing the various scrolls and
 maps. As always she listened in silence and nodded once when he had finished
 speaking. The librarian caught himself staring in to her eyes, wondering at
 whether she ever smiled. He dismissed her abruptly, annoyed with himself for
 letting these thoughts intrude again on his mind. The librarian was so
 caught up with his own world that he failed to notice that the tiefling
 woman pocket a scroll labeled 'Elysium, Blessed Fields'.

 Psioce felt as if each step that he took would be his last. The bleeding had
 stopped awhile ago and his limbs all felt numb. The harmonium officer could
 not remember if that was a good sign or not, but he kept all of his
 concentration focused on putting one foot down in front of the other. It
 seemed as if an eternity had passed when he finally looked up and saw the
 small iron gate leading to the park. The street appeared as if it was
 deserted, but the veteran officer could feel the eyes of a watcher burning
 in to his back. Psioce stumbled in to the abandoned park and collapsed to
 the ground next to the fountain. Looking around him at the withered bushes
 and the smothering razorvine, he noticed for the first time that the
 fountain was completely filled with pigeon feathers. However, as the last
 traces of consciousness slipped away from him, Psioce saw the park in his
 minds eye in its former glory. Understanding blossomed in his mind for a
 brief moment before it was swept away by darkness.

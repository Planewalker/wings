Sitting in a large office was a dark elf dressed in black hide garments,
talking into a large, automatically programmed crystal ball, by which
non-wizards can communicate. 
</p><p align=left>
"When is that shipment of swords coming in?" the drow asked with less than
perfect patience. 
</p><p align=left>
"Um, soon, Lord," a voice mumbled from the other side. 
</p><p align=left>
"Soon? Are you avoiding answering because you don't know, or are they
gone?"
</p><p align=left>
A long silence descended upon the conversation. Finally, the being which
the drow is talking to said, "The shipment was waylaid. The deliverers went
through a plane where the bloodwar was happening and--"
</p><p align=left>
"Don't bother to continue. I know the rest," said the dark elf. 
</p><p align=left>
*How am I supposed to run this business when the supply lines are clogged?*
thought the drow in annoyance. 
</p><p align=left>
"Re-place the order and bypass the planes. Hire a Gate," he said aloud. 
</p><p align=left>
"But boss," the little man on the other end whined, "We don't have the
funding for a gate."
</p><p align=left>
"I'll provide," the drow snapped, "Just do it."
</p><p align=left>
"Okay," the man mumbled. 
</p><p align=left>
"I am serious," the drow warned. 
</p><p align=left>
"Okay," the man sighed resignedly. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow dumped the call, not a moment too soon, as the door to his office
burst open and a tall, lovely, silver skinned woman dressed in spider silk
and chain mail strode into the room. 
</p><p align=left>
"Zaknafein!" she exclaimed, "The swords still aren't here!"
</p><p align=left>
When the weapons master had decided to put together a mercenary
organization by which those in need could find their fighters, mages,
clerics, and what have you for whatever jobs, he can contacted all of his
old mercenary acquaintances to find out whether they were interested in
becoming involved. The High Ogre descendant, Tirysa, 
had come quickly to mind, as the strange adventure that he had shared with
her was not one easily forgotten. The business had been booming for almost
five years, though there were occasionally problems, such as the delivery
of goods across the planes, and the woman had risen high in the
organization. 
</p><p align=left>
"I know," he said simply, standing from his desk and stretching cat-like.
"I've replaced the order. They'll be arriving via a gate."
</p><p align=left>
"Oh are they?" she asked, "We don't have that much in the transportation
budget. The Bloodwars have been intense lately, and they're clogging up the
supply lines. You know that. Gate costs have tripled."
</p><p align=left>
"I'm providing from my own funds," he replied. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well, that's fine," she said, "But you can't keep doing that. What are we
going to do about this if the wars continue at this intensity for much
longer?"
</p><p align=left>
"They're always intense," Zaknafein said, "I have, however, set out a
descrete advertisement that we are looking for another wizard to join us.
It was answered two days ago by one in possession of a gate himself. I'm
going to talk to him today about use of the gate."
</p><p align=left>
"Sounds good," Tirysa said, nodding thoughtfully. "But what makes you think
that this wizard will let us?"
</p><p align=left>
"Because that wizard is my very good friend Grew," Zaknafein said, grinning
in triumph, "He's finally decided to join in. Not in the traveling
department of course, he says he's too old for it, though I'm certain he
could do it if he put his will to it. But he's going to lend his services
in scrying, teleporting, and the like."
</p><p align=left>
"Well, you finally convinced the cutter," she said, rolling her eyes
theatrically. "Okay, you win. I'd say drinks are on me for solving the
problem, but I don't think you'd much appreciate it."
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein snorted, walking around the desk. Tirysa had never been a big fan
of the undead, which Zaknafein was, but she'd made allowances for her
friend and boss. It was a standing joke between them. 
</p><p align=left>
"I'd accept," he murmured, "But I'm not a vampire," he grinned wickedly. 
</p><p align=left>
"Riiiiight," she drawled, "Luckily for both of us, because I'm not big on
holy icons."
</p><p align=left>
"Are we finished?" the drow asked, a slight smile cutting across his
ebon-skinned and sharp featured face. 
</p><p align=left>
"Maybe," she said, chuckling, "Come on, let's see what Sigil has to offer
tonight," she offered her arm, which he accepted, and the two mercenaries
walked out of the office, slamming the door behind them.

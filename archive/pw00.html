<p align=left>
The Gray Waste is a lonely place to call a kip. Certain berks who perish
and didn't follow a certain power, end up on this sickly plane. This gray plane
doesn't have any visible light, but there is enough for normal sight during the
"day". A body can turn barmy on this plane, after a few days, all the berk's
clothes change to gray, and the sod becomes so hopeless that after a week, the
sod loses his sense of self and turn into a larva. Being herded by a Night Hag
isn't too appealing thought to even the most clueless prime barmy. Besides the
sense of hopelessness, host of feeble petitioners with little hope of getting
away from the bleak gray plane, hoards of foul Tanar'ri and the bold Baatezu
fight on each of the three gray planes. The vicious Yugoloths trade sides,
betray each side to make a better profit. It is rarely quiet in the Gray Waste,
either sounds of battle, mournful sods, or the Night Hags rustling of packs of
Larvae. However one sod was lying on the plane, and unlike most of the time on
this plane, it was quiet.

The berk was wearing unusual clothing, something that looked like a tunic that
was white with small blue stripes over it. This body's tunic was already
turning gray, so he must have been here a few days. His pants were torn, and
also unusual, they looked like pantaloons, but not so baggy. These seemed to be
made from some unknown fabric and were black. This berk was sure to become a
Night Hag's barmy in a few days, but interestingly enough he has a silver
bastard sword lying next to him. This berk, might be more than he seems. I will
have to find out whether he is a cutter who lost his way, or some berk who
deserves to die.

A gate opened up and four little gargoyle creatures pop out. These creatures
are called Spinagon. These are the lowest level of Baatezu that I wouldn't just
whip into my mouth and chew them up. Actually I do chew them up, but they are
actually Baatezu. If this basher can defeat them, he may be worthy to join the
Blood War, and help us slay some of those foul Tanar'ri. A roar let out as the
Spinagons raced towards him. Fools, why didn't they just send a yugoloth over
to alert him that they were going to attack? I don't see them being promoted
anytime soon. Not so surprisingly the human jumped up. He wasn't very tall for
a human, but doesn't show any signs of being a half-elf, tiefling or aasimar.
He stood only a little over five and a half feet tall. He lifted his sword, and
slashed the first Spinagon. The little sod went reeling from the blow. The
other three attacked him. The mortal was fast, and dodged out of their way. The
first little creature came back up to strike him, but his sword struck first,
and the Spinagon was down. The other three struck fiercely, one struck him with
his mace. Pain struck his face, but it turned into a snarl. The Cutter struck
the little basher and he never got back up. Impressive! The others hit him in
the sides, bones cracked, and the basher bellowed. Lesser bashers would have
given up. but this basher is a tough warrior. He smashed another one, and it
rattled the little berk. The other Spinagon swung and he painfully dodged his
mace. His silver blade was blackened with blood, and still he double handed
slashed him and he fell. Valiantly he slashed at the last fiend. but clumsily
missed. Seems his ribs welled with pain when he tried to swing, and dropped his
sword. The two wounded berks circled each other. The fiend swung his mace at
him. The larger, wounded basher rushed him, and smashed the little fiend with
his fists, the Spinagon brought up his mace, but the mortal grabbed it and
ripped it from his grasp. The mortal smashed the little fiend's head in, with
all his might, which really wasn't much, but was enough to slay the last one.

The mortal fell over, this time blood was running from several places in his
body. The basher was close to being put in the dead book. This cutter could be
worth something. I lifted the mortal over my shoulder and he groaned over the
roughness of my scales. He'll go to training camp in Avernus, and then if this
one kills as many of those foul Tanar'ri as he seems capable of, my promotion
will be insured. The cold wastes of Caina are quite uplifting. I didn't get
this far by being wrong. This one, once healed, should be whipped into shape.
He needs to lose some weight too; for a small human, he is too fat.

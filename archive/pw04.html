My little pawn won his first battle, but he decided to run away, out on
the Gray Waste. Fool! He will surely perish. Look at all I gave that foolish
mortal. I gave him command, power, an army who will die for him. What does he
do? Betray us! Xrist has taken command of the army, and is now hunting down my
pawn. I think I will torture him some if Xrist brings him back alive. Bane
bested him in combat, the berk didn't kill him. He will have to this time. If
Bane somehow bests Xrist again, I will send some fiends to dispatch him. Bane
might lose, if Xrist's power decides he wants Bane in the dead book. He's
pretty useful though, could be used to weaken a balor enough so I can overwhelm
it. Insubordination can not be tolerated though, so if Bane's put in the dead
book, so be it.

 I just received my first report, ironically they found a dead maralith in the
direction of the supposed path of Bane. The weapons were left there and he had
a number of sword slashes that were obviously made by a bastard sword. My
little pawn is more powerful than I thought. I heard he defeated the leader of
the mortal army for the Tanar'ri Gazlet, slew him, and looked like he was
killed. but next moment, he was completely healed. The sword must be magical. I
heard that it was some sort of fiend slayer, which with his fighting skills
could allow him to slay a maralith. Interesting, apparently, one of the
alu-fiends that Bane cut down, actually survived, she looked dead, and so he
went on. She got up after the battle was over and fled. If she is like most
Tanar'ri, she will go after him too to get her vengeance. We won the battle,
and my promotion to Gelugon will be assured, if I can get Bane back. He could
help me win another battle and I will be promoted.

The cutter found a Gate, but it was a gate to another plane of the Gray Waste.
It makes me laugh. Xrist's legion will reach him soon. In the very least they
could bring back his body so I could feast on it. Hmm, seven warriors and a
priest of a power of strife is after him. The cutter did train them, so he
knows their weaknesses, and he has bested the priest, but eight to one should
be no contest. Of course he's a tough cutter, barmy for trying to betray me,
but if I were to face him, there would be no doubt who would be the victor,
fiend slayer sword or not. I won't need to, I have a Red Abashai who has a
troop of black Abashai to hunt him down. Bane may have been lucky enough to
defeat one black Abashai, but twenty. Heh, he has no hope.

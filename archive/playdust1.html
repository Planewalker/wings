I was sitting in a Sigilian bar, sipping at a shot of liquid gold. It was 
just another day in the Cage, just another rainy day, to be precise. And
anyone who knows the Cage knows that the rain there is thick as oil. In fact, 
some have speculated that it really is oil. I'd been caught out in it, ran 
to the nearest tavern, and, as there was nothing else to do, proceeded to get 
drunk. By the time he walked in, I was about halfway there. He was a drow, 
tall for one, dressed in black, as they usually are, double swords hanging 
from his waist. I hear that on the Prime, a drow's appearance will cause 
panic and dozens of people trying to take off said drow's head from said 
drow's neck. In the Cage, we get everything. Creatures of all kinds, and one 
drow is not going to cause a row unless he actually tries to provoke it, and 
even then, we'd jump on him because he was trying to provoke a row, not 
because of his race. Anyway, the drow didn't order anything. Instead, he 
walked over to a table where a middle aged tiefling, probably a mage, I 
figured from his garments, sat. The tiefling had apparently already ordered 
for the both of them, as there were two wine cups sitting there on that 
table. I noticed, though, that the drow never actually drank any of the wine. 
I watched with idle interest as a conversation commenced, not that I could
hear any of it, but the drow was really good looking, and even the tiefling 
wasn't half bad. Okay, so I wasn't strictly watching. I was leering, quietly, 
and from a distance. The drow seemed to be telling a story, as he talked
on a length, with the tiefling occasional sticking in questions or some such.
Afterwards, they both leaned back in contemplation, thoughtful looks on their
faces. A few minutes after, the tiefling said his goodbyes, and walked out. I 
shrugged and went back to contemplating the drow, who was staring up at the 
ceiling. 
</p><p align=left>
Suddenly, he drew a dagger from his cloak, stared at it for a few minutes. 
So, I'm sitting there, wondering just what he's going to do with the thing, 
wondering why I had to get drunk today. If I'd been a bit more coherent, I
would have went over and introduced myself. But-no such luck. 
The drow sighed, stuck the dagger back into his cloak, and stood up. 
As he walked out the door, I sighed too, in disappointment. As the last bit 
of that sigh left my mouth, my table suddenly shuddered a bit. Dragging my 
eyes over the source of the disturbance, I came face to face with a
sometime employer of mine, an overgrown scro-based vampire type. He's one of 
the Dustmen, go figure. Not everyone is part of a faction, of course, but 
Sigil has it's fair share of faction-types. He grinned at me, real 
suggestive-like, smug as hell. Ya, right, buddy, I'm thinking. What in Abyss
are you here for? Out loud, I just acknowledge his presence, saying his name grudgingly. 
</p><p align=left>
"Kyger," I sounded surly. 
</p><p align=left>
He grinned again, this time at my less than welcoming tone. Anyone that
knows me, knows that conversation, when I'm drunk, is not my long-suit. 
</p><p align=left>
"Tirysa," he spoke my name in return.
</p><p align=left>
We sat there, staring at each other for several minutes, waiting to see
which one of us would break the silence first. I despise games of any sort, 
especially these "greater will" ones, so when someone plays them, I usually
ignore it, or take violent measures to end it, each course of action
depending upon my state of mind and/or body at the time. In this instance, 
I took option A, most due to my state of body. 
</p><p align=left>
"I have a job for you," he finally spoke. 
</p><p align=left>
Well, now we're getting somewhere. 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh?" 
</p><p align=left>
He nodded, smiled, elaborated. "As you know, my representative faction," and
here I take a pause a mental snort of disdain. Representative faction? Ya, 
right. ". . .Is interested in the dead, and the undead, of all types. It 
has recently come to our attention that there has been in Sigil, upon
occasion, an unknown type of undead creature. We would like you to locate
it, currently, and extract skin, and if it still carries the substance, blood
samples, so that the Dustmen, as we are so crassly referred to, may 
deduce the circumstances of this creature's undead making."
</p><p align=left>
Talk about long winded, why don't you? Scro are rare in the Planes, as they 
tend to stick in the Prime's Wildspace, but those Planars that know scro
know that they tend to be far more intelligent than their cousins, the orcs. 
Let me tell you, it just makes them ten times more arrogant. Kyger may have
the jink to hire me, but he himself is nothing more than an overblown egotist.
</p><p align=left>
"Will you except it?" he asked.
</p><p align=left>
"Fine," I responded, before I actually had time to really think it over. 
High priced merc or not, in order to obtain that high-price you've got 
to have cutters willing to hire you, and that hadn't been happening much 
lately. Things had been quiet, or at least as quiet as Sigil gets. 
</p><p align=left>
"Good," he smiled. 
</p><p align=left>
"So, just who is this new gobbly-gook?" I snickered.
</p><p align=left>
He ignored my commentary there, knowing full well what I personally thought
of undead. It had never stopped him from hiring me, and had never stopped
me from excepting. 
</p><p align=left>
"A drow. The name is Zaknafein Do'Urden. A warrior, by all reports. A very
skilled one. You'll have to be very quick, and very quiet to complete this 
task," he smiled, tit for tat like. 
</p><p align=left>
Then, he reached into his cloak, pulling out a flat disk adorned with a 
single small switch, of the like that spell-casters use to capture images 
within. The scro pressed the switch, and an image sprang upon from the disk. 
It was of a drow, tall for one, dressed in black, twin long swords about his
waist, and very good looking. The same drow from the very bar I was sitting in. 
</p><p align=left>
"This is the subject," Kyger said. 
</p><p align=left>
Well, maybe I should re-evaluate my opinion of undead, I thought.
At least. . .some of them. 
</p>

<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Two</u></font>
<p align=left>
"So," I drawled into the face of a long time friend of mine, a slight grin
tracing the outline of my lips, "Do you know of him?"
</p><p align=left>
Now sober, I was able to deal at this situation with more clarity. Certainly, 
it was an intriguing "assignment," and I had every intention
of going through on this. But on the next day, details were
began to surface in my mind. Nothing was ever so simple as finding 
someone and getting a job done.
</p><p align=left>
My friend, a female gnome called Meg, looked at me dubiously, and questioned, 
"Why are asking me about it? Do I look like an information broker?" And 
she wasn't, technically. Still, Meg knew things, knew what was happening 
around her, knew how to come through for her friends. 
</p><p align=left>
"I just accepted a job," I began to explain, "But things have been down so 
low lately that the only jink I've got has to go to my rent, see? So, I
figured, you may have heard something. My employer said the cutter's been 
seen around the Cage, so. . ." I trailed off suggestively.
</p><p align=left>
She eyed me irritably for a long moment. It's true, I don't have the most
stable income. Most mercs don't. Then again, most save up as they go 
along. I don't, and I never have. Any jink I get burns a hole in my 
pocket. Not literally, but it weights upon my mind until I just have to 
buy something. So, by the time it comes to purchase something I need, I 
usually have nothing left. Meg was used to this, used to giving information
to me, which I did pay for, eventually. But still, she never ceased to 
give me a hard time about it when I asked. She probably meant for me to 
change my ways, but I don't see than happening any time soon.
</p><p align=left>
"Tirysa, I don't know how you've survived all these years, depending upon
others as you do. You've got no responsibility, and the only reason you ever
managed to leech as much jink as you do, out of those jobs you get, is 
'cause you target idiots to hire you," she lectured, eyeing me sternly. 
</p><p align=left>
We both knew though, that the speech was just for show. True, some of my 
employers are thick-skulled, mush-brained bashers, but that's just the pick 
of the draw, so to speak. Irresponsible I may be, but I do know how to fight, 
and how to be subtle, when I need to be. I know how to earn my pay. 
</p><p align=left>
"I swear," I began to promise, bargaining, "When I get my full pay, I'll 
give you one third," I promised, being highly generous. I usually was, in
these promises. The amount would go down, later, I knew, and so did she. 
</p><p align=left>
"Full pay?" she inquired archly.
</p><p align=left>
"Well, Kyger did give me some-"
</p><p align=left>
"Kyger? You accepted another job from him?" she grumbled. She'd never liked 
Kyger, and though I wasn't too fond of him either, her dislike was more 
intense than mine ever was. 
</p><p align=left>
"I was drunk," I defended myself, "And besides, it sounded interesting."
</p><p align=left>
Looked good too, I added to myself, silently, but since I had only 
found out who the subject was after I accepted the job, it didn't really 
count as a reason. 
</p><p align=left>
"That's no excuse, Tir. None at all," she paused a moment, muttered under
her breath and, finally, added, "But I know what kind of trouble you could
get in if you don't get a job from the Dustmen finished. So, yes, I have
heard of the drow. He's a loner, keeps to himself. Well, he does know
one cutter in the Cage. A tiefling mage called Grew. He owns a mageshop. 
The tiefling, that is. Grew's the only one that the drow seems to socialize 
with," she shrugged, and added, "All I know besides that is that he hires 
himself out a merc, to very select customers. Not necessarily rich ones, 
though most are, but he seems to have a code."
</p><p align=left>
"A bit more than you would usually would know, off hand," I pointed out, 
a bit suspicious. 
</p><p align=left>
She shrugged, and eyed me irritably. "Someone else was asking about him, 
somewhere, and I happened to overhear them," she trailed off, obviously
not want to say anymore. 
</p><p align=left>
Just overheard someone? Coincidence, or what? Who else was asking about this 
drow? And another mercenary? Interesting. Not that mercenaries are uncommon,
or anything. I mean, any berk can tell you they're not. But I wondered why
Kyger hadn't told me that. 'The plot thickens, as it were,' I thought to 
myself with a grin. Far from being put off, I was beginning to truly enjoy myself. 
</p><p align=left>
"Interesting," I drawled to Meg, and then, with a grin, and a wink at the 
gnome, I yelled "Thanks!" as I skipped out the door, before even she could
get a word in edgewise. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="3"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Three</u></font>
<p align=left>
It was dark and dirty, and not in a good way. That was the area of town that
Meg had chosen to live in, and who was I to protest? Well, I did. I did
almost every time I didn't want something from her. I get in my jabs when 
I have nothing to loose and something to gain, upon general principle. 
I hoped that this Grew's mageshop wasn't in this area. They generally aren't,
mageshops, but you never know. I should have asked Meg for directions, but 
that would have given her the chance to further pick my brain and job, which
just is not a comfortable position to be in. And, after all, I snickered
sarcastically to myself as I stalked up the street, remaining to question
further would have ruined my theatrical exit. It was too late, though. 
If I went back, I would get nothing from Meg now, and I knew it. One strike
and you're out is pretty much that gnome's life-motto. 
</p><p align=left>
Sigil is confusing place to live, huge and multi-dimensional. Almost no 
one bothers to keep track of everything in it. But someone, somewhere, 
knows a bit of it, and some other someone knows another bit. It all adds up. 
There was someone who could tell me where the tiefling's mageshop was. 
But, that would have to wait. I now knew for sure now that someone was 
following me. They were being subtle, footsteps light, shadows concealed, 
but I could feel it. I could sense the eyes upon my back, the anticipation.
It was building in me, as well. The lust for violence, the shock when the 
one *hunting* me found out just who was the hunter. The other, a shadow at 
my back, was much closer now. I let him approach, wanting him near me, every
particle of my being now focused upon the situation at hand.
</p><p align=left>
Without warning, I whirled upon my pursuer, smashing it up against a wall
with all my might, slapping it's face several times before I even viewed it, 
and pushing my own snarling visage right in. 
</p><p align=left>
"Do you know where the mageshop run by a tiefling named Grew is?" I growled, 
demanding an answer. 
</p><p align=left>
My captive gave a slow blink. He certainly hadn't been expecting that question. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
The mageshop was dark inside, but not shabbily so. It was an elegant, and, 
truth to tell, expensive sort of darkness. The walls were cool grey
marble, as were the shelves upon which the wares were piled. Cabinets full
of magical trinkets, bags of components, bits of this and that. I don't know
magic well, but I know quality. The very air smelt rich. Obviously, this 
was no bargain basement shop. 
</p><p align=left>
Lounging in a chair of silver leather was the self-same tiefling I had 
spotted in the tavern but a day before. He was reading from a large, purple
skinned tome. Most people would assume it was a spellbook, but I would 
point out that wizards need to have their fun, too, and guess it was a trashy novel. 
</p><p align=left>
Though most, in this sort of situation, would take a round about approach, 
asking sly questions and such like, I, as I have mentioned upon previous 
occasion, have never had the patience for such games. I walked up to the 
wizard, steps purposeful, and without pretense I asked, 
</p><p align=left>
"Do you know of the current whereabouts of Zaknafein Do'Urden?"
</p><p align=left>
"Why do you want to know?" questioned a voice, smooth and accented and most
certainly not emerging from the tiefling, who was looking up at me from his 
leather perch like I was a complete and utter moron. 
</p><p align=left>
I turned toward the door, where the voice had directed itself from. Standing
there was the self-same "mystery undead" I had been hired to acquire samples
of. He was eyeing me with a mix of suspicion and contemptuous amusement. 
The tiefling gave a quiet chuckle, and went back to his book, tuning out my
existence. Have you ever felt as though you were the butt of some unknown 
joke, which becomes all the more un-amusing for you because you don't know
'why' everyone is laughing at you? That is just the way I felt at the very
moment the tiefling gave his chuckle. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow did not wait for a reply, he simply began walking toward me, 
unhurriedly, smiling ever so slightly. I shrugged at him, trying to appear
as unhurried and casual as he seemed. 
</p><p align=left>
"A friend of mine is interested in your services," I replied lightly, mixing
the truth with lies, as it were. 
</p><p align=left>
"Maybe it's that idiot from Limbo you told me about," the tiefling suggested, 
not looking up from his gaudily-covered book.
</p><p align=left>
"Certainly not," the drow spoke, "It would have simply whirled in here itself, 
rather than extending transparent offers of employment through suspicious
looking friends."
</p><p align=left>
I almost replied that I did not look suspicious, but the drow was looking more
unfriendly by the minute. So, I thought to myself, how are I going to get 
this job done when my target is supposedly a whole lot more skilled than 
I am, and is already looking at me like I'm dinner? Okay, maybe that was
an incorrect metaphor. I mean, it's not as though he's a vampire.
</p><p align=left>
"I'm serious," I replied as though I were hurt by his mistrust. 
</p><p align=left>
"No doubt," was his wry reply as he stretched out, like a cat, in one of the
empty silver leather chairs. I stood there, as though nothing were out the 
ordinary as he fixed me with piercing eyes. Suddenly, I was struck by an idea. 
</p><p align=left>
"My friend's name is Kyger. He's heard about you, and wants to hire you for 
a job. He's been very busy, lately, though, and so he sent me. I extend his
invitations of hospitality to you, in good faith," I smiled after delivering
this impromptu mini-speech. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow's slender white eyebrows lifted up high now, in genuine amusement. 
My plan, which was meant to accomplish both of my goals, was now set into 
motion. Now, the only thing to do was wait and see if my target would take 
the bait. If he excepted my "invitations of hospitality" I would most
certainly do my best to make his comfortable. And then, I would bind him and
take the samples desired by the Dustmen. Job accomplished. Most people would
say that this being seemed a bit too knowing to fall for such tricks, but 
old methods often work best.  
</p><p align=left>
I smiled again, not innocently, as that would have been a dead give away, 
but professionally, not giving away a thought in my head. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="4"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Four</u></font>
<p align=left>
I gave a small smile as I poured the wine into the goblets on the table, 
wondering just what his reaction would be. I don't know, some undead can 
drink stuff, but others couldn't even if their unlives depended upon it. 
This one, though, simply gave a small grin and ignored the cup. I was, I'll
admit, disappointed. I was looking for something of a more extreme reaction.
But then, what the hell? There isn't much you can say to a cup of wine, unless
it's some sort of secret weapon against your breed or some such.
I sat down across from him, letting the silence increase it's own weight as
the time went on. He, however, seemed perfectly content to let the room
maintain it's silence. When this drow had accepted my invitation, I was
truly gleeful, and yet. . .There was something very knowing, very canny
about Zaknafein. I received the feeling that he was perfectly aware of my
plans. All there was left was whether he was going to go along with them. 
There was another thing, though, that I had neglected to truly contemplate.  
He was undead, and quite a few undead types just don't work in that manner. 
I frowned to myself, deeply. What a perfectly horrid thought. Well, best to 
dive in head first and find out, rather than never know. 
</p><p align=left>
I leaned forward, and my spider-silk tunic dipped down to outline the curves
of my body. Rest assured, I know how to dress for occasion. A spark of 
knowing interest lite in the drow's eyes as his long hands ran down the 
velvet covered arms of the chair he was seated in. I smiled.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
My first thought upon waking was that my unasked question had been answered.
He most certainly worked. My second thought, chasing at lightening speed 
after the first, was that I was once more dressed, with the sudden
addition of being bound by adamantium cables, which molded to my wrists and 
ankles with slithery snakes, and yet were as unmovable as age old boulders. 
Judging from the grim expression upon the face of the drow who was, once 
more, sitting in the velvet chair, whilst I was bound, sitting on the chair 
opposite him, this was not some sort of kinky game. 
</p><p align=left>
"Untie me at once!" I shouted before I quite took the time to think, voice
sounding imperiously enough. I think I've been spending too much time around
self-righteous scro. 
</p><p align=left>
"I don't think so," his voice was no longer half edged in amusement. It was 
flat and cold. He had me where he wanted me, and there was no backing out now.
It seemed that he had turned my plan upon itself, and aimed it right in my
own direction. I really hate it when that happens. 
</p><p align=left>
"You have to give the Dustmen credit," he spoke again, "They do learn after
a some near a dozen agents leave my company a bit more dead than they entered
it. I suppose they hired you in hopes I would not suspect such a fool as their agent."
</p><p align=left>
Huh? Okay, I was somewhat insulted by the fool bit, but the fact that there 
have been Dustmen sent after this one. . .Well, let's just say that I'd 
be having an interesting conversation with Kyger when I got out of this
situation. If I got out of this situation.
 </p><p align=left>
I scowled at him and snarled, "What is all this for!? I have no idea what 
you're talking about!" 
</p><p align=left>
He eyed me with the exaggerated patience of one who had hear such things 
before and had absolutely no belief in protests of the sort. Personally, I
really couldn't blame him. I wouldn't believe it either, but perhaps if I 
kept it up long enough, he would start to doubt that he was correct, which
would give me the time to at least attempt to figure an escape. 
</p><p align=left>
"I have every idea what I am talking about. You are not the one, after all, 
who was hunted for samples of your body tissues, but which to control you,"
he hissed, sudden anger lighting his eyes in a flash of crimson fire. It is
just not pleasant to be on the receiving end of such look from those eyes. 
Wait a moment, I thought to myself as his words sunk in, to control you? Well, 
I can see why you would be pissed off. Not that I'm surprised that the Dusties
would want to control a new undead type, but I was lead to believe my little
collection job was simply for research purposes. "It was, actually," I snickered
to myself, "With a vengeance."
</p><p align=left>
"Who knows," I smirked at him then, "You may enjoy it. Then again, the Dustmen
never did have much imagination," I laughed. 
</p><p align=left>
Contrary to the annoyance I had expected, the knowing rage that flashed with
brief, blatant appearance over his features was shocking. Apparently, I had
hit a nerve. 
</p><p align=left>
"I assure you," he growled, "I know very well what being controlled is like, 
and I do not enjoy it. I do not care to experience anything the Dustmen have
in store for me. I do care to keep my will to myself. To that end, you are
going to tell me exactly how you came to be hunting for me."
</p><p align=left>
I sighed, deep, long, and most importantly to him, resignedly. The way I saw it, at this point, I had no 
choice to speak of. I opened my mouth, and began to recount the events of the last couple days. 
With certain exceptions to the events, of course. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
He was somewhat glum and annoyed by the time I was finished my narrative. Apparently, I knew nothing 
useful. However, a few, silent moments later and he stood, walking over to stand beside me. He drew the 
dagger he had drawn in the tavern not even two days before and retrieved from my waist a loose-tied 
pouch I kept there. Without a warning, dagger moving faster than my eyes could follow it, the dagger 
neatly sliced off a long sliver of flesh from his forearm. I grimaced in shock, and he grimaced in distaste 
as he dropped the flesh into the pouch. 
</p><p align=left>
"What's that for!?"
</p><p align=left>
"You," he explained, "Will take this to your employer. Act as though you acquired it without my 
assistance. Thus, he will analyse the powers and limitations of my current state of being. The study will 
also reveal how the Dustmen would go about controlling my form. If I have this information, I can almost 
certainly prevent it. If you deliver this without incident, you will be fine. However, if you deviate from that 
course, I will kill you," he spoke with absolute seriousness, but I simply could not resist a jab. It revealed 
my nervousness, actually. I generally become more sarcastic as I become more upset. 
</p><p align=left>
"Ah, and after all we've shared," I mocked. 
</p><p align=left>
The by now familiar contemptuous look of amusement flashed in his eyes for the briefest of moments 
before he spoke, tone just as mocking as my own had been.
</p><p align=left>
"All's fair in love and war."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="5"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Five</u></font>
<p align=left>
I forced a purposeful edge to my stride, the confident feel of one who has
well completed a job showing in the fall of my boots, but inside, I was
very annoyed. I mean, there's only so much a girl can put up with in a few
days. Having your own plans turned on you, is rather like having your nose
rubbed in your own dung. Still, what was I to do? The quickest way to
escape from the situation was to deliver the skin. If the drow wanted to
risk it, that was his problem. I was just going to hand the sample over the
Kyger, and get out Sigil for a while, at least until Zaknafein Do'Urden was
out of the city. I think he meant what he said. Of course, threats of death
can be simply bluff, upon the part of some beings, but somehow, I don't
think that drow is the bluffing type. 
</p><p align=left>
Kyger's "domicile" was a richly appointed house carved from black marble.
Funny how the Dustmen worship death, and yet their possessions seem so free
of decay. Of course, I am sarcastic. All the factions tend to hypocritical
in some manner or another. I knocked upon the heavy door three times in a
row, playing up to a joke that Kyger wouldn't appreciate. They say Death
knocks three times before he comes for you, or some such. But by this time,
I didn't care if Kyger didn't appreciate my humours. Just as I was about to
knock again, the door was opened, and a thin, fleshy face peeked through. A
zombie, I noted as I grimaced. Most Dustmen of a certain rank have a few
token undead or so. Judging from the lowliness of zombies in general
though, Kyger wasn't too high on the scale. The zombie moved an arm
jerkily, motioning me to enter the house. Cautiously, keeping the zombie in
view, I stepped inside the door. The zombie looked me over, and I could
have sworn he was taking my measure. After a moment, it pointed to a
polished corner table in the hallway. Giving the zombie a dirty look as I
did, I walked to the table. There was a note upon it. 
</p><p align=left><blockquote>
Tirysa,<br><Br>
      I am so sorry, my dear, but I have urgent and sudden out of Sigil
business at this time that simply cannot be ignored. Assuming you 
are reading this, I am still away and you have completed your task. 
Thus, I advice you to take the samples to a trusted colleague of mine, 
Freqtw, at his residence in Sigil. He can be found but several houses 
from my own domicile. It's the green one with the yellow trimming. 
Genius he may be, but that wizard has no taste. He knows who you
are, and I'm sure he'll be very helpful. Have a good day. 
<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Kyger
</blockquote></p><p align=left>
That pompous bastard! was my first thought after I placed the letter back
upon the table. How dare he send me to some wizard who no doubt has no
instructions or desire to pay me. Damn it. I really would be having a talk
with Kyger, I swore once more to myself. Best to get this over with,
though, I reminded myself. Grimacing I prepared to face the horror of the
yellow and green mansion. 
</p><p align=left>
If there is one thing that Kyger and I agree upon, it is just how ugly that
house really is. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
I could not help myself from giving into the urge to theatrically shudder
as I rang the huge and gaudy golden bell that hung above the enormous
double doors of the house. I was halfway between the twin urges to hurl and
to laugh. A moment later and the door opened with cautious force, rendering
both options to the background of my thoughts. A human man, wearing
silver-gray robes that matched his wild gray hair, which stuck out in every
direction possible, and then some.  His eyes were a darker, steely gray that 
were filled with caution and wild inspiration. 
</p><p align=left>
"Who are you?" he asked, irritably enough. 
</p><p align=left>
I stuck my hand on my hip, pursed my lips and announced, "I am Tirysa."
</p><p align=left>
The wizard, Freqtw, stared at me for a long moment, and then he shrugged.
"Oh, well. Are you here with that skin stuff?"
</p><p align=left>
"Uh, yes," I said, staring at him somewhat incredulously. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well, come on in then. But don't expect me to pay you anything!"
</p><p align=left>
I gave a groan as I stepped in the door, thinking of that comment,  'Just as I suspected.'
</p><p align=left>
The inside of the wizard's house was somewhat shocking. I could not help
but gape as I gazed up the exquisite decoration, subtle highlights of
metallics and pearl inlaid through the main hall and the visible adjoining
rooms. Artifacts and stark furniture adorned here and there, the whole
impression amounting to dark, barren beauty. I hadn't realized that my
mouth was slightly hanging open until the wizard reached over, grasped my
chin, and clamped my jaw shut. I yanked away from his touch, and opened my
mouth again to ask, but he beat me to the question. 
</p><p align=left>
"The outside keeps the thieves away. They assume that the inside is just as
bad," he grinned, evidently quite pleased with his reasoning. I have to
admit, though, that it was rather clever. 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh. I suppose you get that question a lot, hmm?"
</p><p align=left>
"Actually, no. Most people that come in here are beyond asking," he grinned meaningfully. 
</p><p align=left>
"Wonderful," I said. 
</p><p align=left>
I was steadily following him as we walked, down the halls. By the time the
last comment exited my mouth, we turned into a room, plush and full over a
multitude of velvet cushions. On a long mahogany table, there rested
several huge books, and crystal vases and bottles of components. Once more,
I turned incredulously to the wizard. 
</p><p align=left>
"Is this your laboratory?"
</p><p align=left>
"Yup," he confirmed. Noticing my look, he scowled, "What? Did you expect me
to conform to every stereotype about the dusty wizard laboratories, skulls
on shelves, and cobwebs in corners?"
</p><p align=left>
"Of course not," I replied, thinking, 'Whoa, this guy is a fruitcake.'
</p><p align=left>
That was probably one of those stereotypes the wizard was thinking about,
but hey, no one is perfect. 
</p><p align=left>
"Anyway," the wizard said as he lounged in a pile of green cushions, "Give me the skin."
</p><p align=left>
"Sure," I snapped. "Tell Kyger he owns me my pay, though, and don't forget it."
</p><p align=left>
I heard the wizard snort in laughter as I shoved the leather pouch
containing Zaknafein's skin sample towards him, just before I wheeled away,
and stormed down the hall, slamming the door as I exited the house. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>

<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Six</u></font>
<p align=left>
I walked into the apartment I call home when in Sigil. It was appointed
tastefully, walls painted midnight blue, with rich black leather furniture
all about. Reminders of profitable times is what this apartment was. 'I
will not be seeing these rooms for quite sometime,' I thought to myself. I
would take out that old extra dimension pack, stuff it full of clothes and
other possessions, and then get out of town. It was a good plan for one who
did not want to get any more caught up in messy situations than she already
has. There was only one complication, and that was acquiring my pay from
Kyger once he got back. I decided, however, to simply contact him via a
wizard after several months. By that time, he should have returned to
Sigil. Complication unravelled, I set out to find my magic bag.
</p><p align=left>
It was in the old steel trunk in my bedroom, laying nicely with the scant
other magic items I had managed to acquire over the years. There was ring of
healing, which wouldn't fix you if you got stabbed in the heart, but would
close up a gash in your arm or some such. There was a that singing dagger,
which was just a miniature version of a singing sword. And then there was
the bag. It was a midnight blue that, incidentally, matched my walls, and
it had the stereotypical moons and stars all over it. But it was very
useful, and so I put up with the little pictures. I pulled it out, and
stuffed the ring inside, as well as strapping the dagger on my person.  I
also included the pile of ready jink I kept in the trunk. I then proceeded
to pack clothing. It took me roughly an hour to ready myself, but finally,
I was finished. Shrugging on a black cloak, I walked out of my apartment,
locking the door firmly behind me. I decided, though, to let my gnome
friend, Meg, know that I would be gone for a while. She deserved to at
least know that much, and the extra hour or so it would take wouldn't hurt
me, I thought.
</p><p align=left>
That was where I was wrong.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
"I'll be leaving the city for a while," I announced to her without preamble.
</p><p align=left>
Her little face clouded upon with decidedly not a little amount of
displeasure. The scowl seemed to vibrate in the air. I coughed. Meg angry
is not a pretty sight, but I was seeing it.
</p><p align=left>
"What?" she snarled. "What about my pay?"
</p><p align=left>
I just knew she was going to say that. I mean, I would be saying it if I
were her. In fact, I'm me, and I've been wondering about that myself.
Pretty much all my friends and acquaintances are very well and self
acquainted with that very phrase.
</p><p align=left>
"That's why I'm letting you know I'll be gone, Meg. I just didn't want you
to be wondering. But I swear, I will give it to you as soon as--"
</p><p align=left>
"As soon as possible," she interrupted sarcastically.
</p><p align=left>
"Exactly!"
</p><p align=left>
"Right," she snorted, "So, what is the great and urgent matter that takes
you out of city in such haste?"
</p><p align=left>
"Remember that job that I asked for your help about? The one that Kyger
hired me to do? Well, it sort of backfired."
</p><p align=left>
"Sort of backfired? And this was a surprise? I told you before, don't get
involved with that vampire. He's nothing but trouble."
</p><p align=left>
"He's just an occasional employer," I muttered sourly, "It's not as though
he's courting me."
</p><p align=left>
"Not that he wouldn't enjoy that. Or at least the quick and easy meaning he
would tack onto that ritual," she retorted.
</p><p align=left>
"Whatever," I muttered, knowing full well that she was correct. "Anyway, I
don't want to get anymore involved in it than I already am, so I'm leaving
for a while."
</p><p align=left>
"Just how involved in it are you?"
</p><p align=left>
"Involved," I said, not willing to share any more.
</p><p align=left>
Meg heaved a sigh, almost a groan and growled, "Fine. I'll see you later,"
just as she indicated the door out of her home with a jerk of her head.
</p><p align=left>
Heaving a sigh myself, I backed away, assuring her as convincingly as
possible, "I will be back eventually!"
</p><p align=left>
She did not look convinced.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=25%>
<p align=left>
I was but a mile or so from the gate, the magical door, one of those
thousands that are packed in Sigil, those that give the place the name
"City of Doors." It would take me to the Beastlands, a place that I find
enjoyable and, most importantly, a neutral location. Sure, it's dangerous,
but so is every place. I smiled to myself as I walked, but that smile was
surely my last in a while. As sudden as thought, the wizard, Freqtw,
appeared, and smiled.
</p><p align=left>
"I've been informed, by our dear friend Kyger, that you are not to leave
the city until he returns."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="7"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Seven</u></font>
<p align=left>
I scowled at the wizard, angered, but none too surprised. I should have
left earlier, I shouldn't have went to see Meg, I should have just skipped
town without hesitation, I--But that was all hindsight. No sense angsting
over it all now. The question was, was I going to go along with him,
possibly getting even more involved,  or fight back, risking personal
bodily injury, even death? Very tough choice indeed, that one is. In a
sudden flash,  I thought, 'Why not do both?'
</p><p align=left>
I deepened my scowl then, practically snarling at the human, as I hissed,
"Very well," in a defiant, but resigned manner. 
</p><p align=left>
He shrugged, smiled and spoke, "Just stick around. I'm sure he'll be back
soon."
</p><p align=left>
"Right," I snapped sarcastically. 
</p><p align=left>
"Whatever," he replied, seemingly rather indifferent to the whole matter. I
could understand that--If I were him, I wouldn't care about me, either-but
that didn't mean that I liked it.
</p><p align=left>
A moment more, and he was chanting a spell of teleportation, seeking to
bring himself back from wherever he had brought himself from--his house,
presumably. It was but a few seconds as I counted the level of absorption
he held in his spellcasting, enough so that he no longer noticed me, and
then, I threw myself forward, slamming into the wizard, knocking him down,
and, hopefully, out, when he choked out the last syllable and world blurred
all around me. It seems I waited a bit too long. 
</p><p align=left>
As the world once more blurred all around me, my stomach lurched in
protest, not really enjoying these ethereal journeys through space and
time, so to speak. A sharp edge, most certainly not ethereal, then made
contact with my temple, as I smashed into whatever it was, sending me
spiraling into unwilling darkness. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
When I awoke, I was sitting, tied to yet another chair. The second
chair-tying in but several days, and the novelty was already worn off, go
figure. This time, however, the ropes were some sort of strange jelly
substance. I wondered if they were magic, or simply some sort of kids play
goo meant to frighten and disgust people. That would be the sort of thing
that would happen to me. Restrained with play gelatin. I frowned to myself
with sudden vehemence. This was no time to be distracted by jelly
fantasies. I attempted to test the bonds upon my wrists and ankles by
stretching my arms and legs forward against the 'ropes.' Slowly, and
surely, they stretched. My lips curved into a grin and I moved to slip my
feet out of the jell. They were bound as tightly as ever. Confused, I
glanced down, wondering what had happened, and saw that the jell had molded
itself to my movements, encasing my ankles as I moved. Frustrated, I yanked
at my hands. Infuriatingly, I felt the jell tighten like manacles,
smoothing over my wrists like magic gloves. I let out a sudden scream of
frustration, the pent up emotion of the last few days rushing out of me in
a burst of piercing sound, so high it should have shattered glass. It
diverted me from my current situation, and I screamed again, rage running
through me all the while. Gods damn it but I wish I'd never met Kyger,
never caught a single glimpse of that all too good looking drow, never
became a mercenary to begin with!
</p><p align=left>
Face contorted with emotion, I thrashed about in the chair, rocking it back
and forth with increasing vehemence, until without out warning, it smashed
to floor. The wood back gave an audible *crack* as it smashed into the
black marble of the floor surface, and the flowing bindings oozed
downwards, running from my wrists to my sides, smoothing over my legs as it
continued in a seemingly limitless rush. Before I knew could even register
the change, I was completely ensconced from the waist down. Letting out a
final scream of frustration, made all the more intense for my current
situation, I fell silent. I was stuck. And apparently, the wizard was
either not around, or ignoring me. 
</p><p align=left>
I looked up with unreasonable hope, therefor, as the door swung open. My
eyes probably lite up in that moment, even as they widened with shock when
I realized just who my visitor was. 
</p><p align=left>
"What are you doing I here?!" I exclaimed, not even bothering to speak
quietly.
</p><p align=left>
He lifted an elegant brow at me and said, "What I intended to do all along.
Collect the research."
</p><p align=left>
"But it's only been a day!" I exclaimed, "Not even that!"
</p><p align=left>
"That goo seems to have effected your time judgement. It's been a week."
</p><p align=left>
Huh? I though to myself, shocked and confused. 
</p><p align=left>
"I must have been sleeping longer than I thought," I muttered to myself. 
</p><p align=left>
"And just why where you sleeping?"
</p><p align=left>
"The wizard knocked me out!" I snapped, not willing to diverge all the
details. 
</p><p align=left>
The dark elf who stood in the doorway sighed in annoyance, but before he
could speak I asked, "How did you get in here, anyway?"
</p><p align=left>
"That's what I'd like to know," spoke another voice, as the wizard, Freqtw,
appeared in the centre of the room, gazing curiously upon Zaknafein, whilst
standing with his back to me. Considering what had happened last time his
back was to me, that may seem rather foolish, but then again, I was rather.
. .tied up this time. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="8"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Eight</u></font>
<p align=left>
The dark elf ignored the question, instead, moving forward in a lightening
quick motion, arm extended, while the length of a leather whip, ah, whipped
out, wrapping around the legs of the wizard, sending the human crashing to
the floor, smashing my chair half-way across the room. The wizards's head
connected to the sharp corner of a wooden table, which I
assume was what my head originally made contact with when we teleported in
here. . . last week. 
</p><p align=left>
The wizard's body knocked my chair a few feet across the room, smashing
into the nearest wall, my arm ripping along the wall.
There was no time for anything but a shocked exclamation when the wall lit
up with a silver, glow, and the room was engulfed in heat. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
I was getting really tired of this, these spontaneous teleportations, or
transportations, or whatever.  Slowly opening my eyes, almost frightened 
of what I would find, I saw the wizard, Freqtw, lying on his side, lips slightly 
parted, head lolling backwards, eyes closed--floating on air?!
Suddenly alarmed, I sat up, or tried to anyway. The moment I moved, I found
myself spinning in summersaults, whipping through the air. A dark clad arm
moved forward, and slapped the wizard awake as I watched. Eyes gliding over
the arm, I followed it to the dark elf it was a part of. The wizard,
Freqtw, awoke an instant later, scowling, and exclaiming, 
"What in the Abyss did you do that for?!"
</p><p align=left>
Considering the fact that so much had happened, there were some rather
confused looks exchanged, which the wizard did seem to notice, because he demanded, 
</p><p align=left>
"You, drow, why did you knock me down?! Do you know why I had that damn
ogre tied up!? Because my walls are inbuned with magics which are activated
by certain things, including that woman's race!"
</p><p align=left>
What!? How did he know!?, I thought frantically. The drow was looking
somewhat confused, and he exclaimed, "Ogre?" and he chuckled sardonically,
adding, "I know ogres, and she certainly is not one. Though she is as
greedy as one."
</p><p align=left>
The wizard snorted, glancing around at the open air, which was now filled
with rocks, floating slowly by, moss dripping down their sides, bits of
sand and dirt trailing after them. Where were we?
</p><p align=left>
"Ogres weren't always big ugly lumps," Freqtw started to explain, "They
originated in a Prime Material World called Krynn. There, they were the
chosen race of some dark goddess, I think her name was Takhisis. Anyway,
they were tall and graceful, and incredibly beautiful, and all that tripe.
But, of course, they were arrogant and self centered, and enslaved other
races, became decadent, and such like. Well, to make a long story short,
they tore apart their own Empire with infighting, and some self-righteous
light gods decided to cast them from grace, and transform them into ugly
thugs, taking away what they prized most of all--their beauty. But, a group
of them made it to the planes a few millennium before all this, and took of
residence there. So, their descendents have been hanging around ever since.
Of course, after a while, some of them interbred with other races, which
gets you people like this mercenary here, almost as beautiful, greedy and
self centered as a High Ogre, just not quiet pure bred."
</p><p align=left>
I drew as far away from the wizard as I could, noting as I did that the air
was slowly mutating into something a bit more solid, but unable to do
anything about it. The drow was frowning to himself as he considered this
new information, even as he inquired, "Why do your walls react to them?"
</p><p align=left>
The wizard frowned, too, and heaved a sigh, "I have a rival, who employs
the descendent of a High Ogre, herself. If her employee were to ever enter
the room that we were in, which would be the logical choice in which to
steal research and all that, as it is my laboratory, and touch any one of
the four side walls, he would be instantly transported to another plane of
existence, as well as any other organic being in the room. Which explains
why we were effected when she hit the wall." Freqtw paused a moment,
looking somewhat embarrassed as he said, "I would have enchanted the
ceiling and floor as well, but I ran out of Ogre blood."
</p><p align=left>
"Why didn't you just put her in another room?" the drow growled in
exasperation. 
</p><p align=left>
The wizard shrugged, and said, "I wanted to do the floor and ceiling."
</p><p align=left>
It took a moment for this comment to register upon me, though judging from
the drow's raised eyebrow, he understood immediately, but when it did hit
me, my jaw dropped so far down, it would have hit the floor, if there had
been one.
</p><p align=left>
"You were going to slaughter me!?"
</p><p align=left>
"Your death would have went to a good cause," the wizard consoled. 
</p><p align=left>
"Enchanting the floor and ceiling of your laboratory for the off chance
that some thief comes to take your research!? This is supposed to make me
feel better!?" I shrieked in outrage.
</p><p align=left>
"Not really," he shrugged, "Just thought I'd try. Half heartedly, of course."
</p><p align=left>
I gapped in shock, wondering just what was wrong with this man's brain. 
</p><p align=left>
Undeterred, he continued, "When I realized what you were, I made moves to
keep you in Sigil. Kyger's too blind to have made such a move himself. But
you jumped me, and knocked yourself out on the table. So, I tied you up in
the chair, and took blood samples. You're not a complete pure bred, but you
are as close to a High Ogre as it's likely to get these days. So, I figured
I'd use your blood, and make some story up to Kyger about your having been
killed in a fight somewhere. Not, unlikely in Sigil."
</p><p align=left>
I was shocked. No, I was beyond shocked. This man was calmly explaining his
planned murder of me, for some stupid spell.
</p><p align=left>
"Why are you telling me all of this?"
</p><p align=left>
The wizard said, "Puts you off your guard," and grinned. 
</p><p align=left>
"What?!" I exclaimed.
</p><p align=left>
"Excuse my interruption into this touching scene," the drow's wryly
accented voice interrupted, "But where, exactly, were those walls a
transporter to?"
</p><p align=left>
Glancing about as we landed upon the newly formed landscape of solid stone,
and crumbling dirt, I was wondering the same thing.
</p><p align=left>
Freqtx shrugged, the annoyingly careless motion I had already come to
loathe, as he cheerfully announced, "Limbo."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="9"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Nine</u></font>
<p align=left>
I  saw the drow scowl darkly [no pun intended] at the same time the ground
exploded, throwing my chair, and myself, along at least 50 feet into what
passed for the sky in that neighborhood. Flames were erupting all around
me, and the wizard, passing through my suddenly jump-started line of sight,
was flailing all about, but, the craziest thing was that he was grinning,
and hooting, like some hyperactive kid on sugar bombs. The dark elf was
scrambling for any purchase he could find, which was basically none at all,
but, I have to give him credit, he did make quite an effort to find some.
Not that it helped. 
</p><p align=left>
Gyzers were spontaneously spurting up, mingling with the fire, forming
patterns in the, um, "sky." All around, it looked very interesting, but I
wasn't too keen on the possibility of being drown or burned to death.
Nothing personal against the elements, I just hear the experience isn't
very pleasant. Then, suddenly, a ground was approaching-- all too quickly. 
The brown earth and gray rocks were flying into my sight, looking more and
more unfriendly by the moment. I struggled in my chair, but the primordial
goo holding me in place was just not co-operating. 
</p><p align=left>
There was no time for even a scream--not that those ever help in such
situations, but the effect can be at least *somewhat* distracting--as I
braced myself for the impact of what may possibly be the last sight of my
life--The sharp tips of the rocks. 
</p><p align=left>
And then the world turned itself inside out. I could almost say "Bless the
chaos for that," but it was chaos that had me free falling to begin with. 
If only the landscape would stay in one place!  
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
It rich, soft, and red. All guesses were up, and I was covered in red
velvet curtains. The floor was patterned red and white, chess-board like,
and snooty looking beings of all types, sexes, and races were standing
around, wine glasses of something red in their hands. Similar to myself,
they were dressed in red curtains. Okay, they probably weren't curtains, as
all the snobs were prancing around as though they were dressed in the
height of fashion. Maybe they were, oh, what do you call those, something
that a few humans passing through Sigil had once called their outfits. . .
Oh, ya. Togas.  So, what was everyone on the chess board doing, wearing
these things, and tacky red ones at that? Where had this room come from?
Was I even in Limbo anymore? Part of me, of course, hoped that I wasn't. I
mean, there's only so much I could have taken from that wizard, and I'd
been reaching the end of my rope as it was, and then there was the dark
elf, who was not on entirely friendly terms with me, but on the other hand,
the wizard had been a possible ticket out of the chaos. Maybe he had a
teleport spell, or something. But, due to my sudden appearance in the toga
party, I was on my own. Without warning, a tall elf woman with emerald hair
and metallic silver skin swept over to me, her red velvet contrasting
*really badly* with her hair. 
</p><p align=left>
"Darling! It's been so looong," she exclaimed, drawing her already trilling
voice out into a pronounced, annoying drawl. 
</p><p align=left>
I stared baldly at the elf for a long moment, while she stood before me
with an expectant expression stamped all over her face. 
</p><p align=left>
"Hello," I stated, my voice basically handing out printed flyers that had
"Who the hell are you?" stamped all over them in letters as long and red as
her dress. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well, don't just stand there, dear!" Her Tackiness exclaimed, "The games
shall be starting soon! We really must hurry, or we shall be late!"
</p><p align=left>
Huh? Games, what games? And didn't this woman get the fact that I didn't
know who she was? Apparently not, as she kept tugging at my arm, pulling me
across the room. Apparently, though, we were rather late for. . . whatever
these games were, because everyone else had already filed out the
checkerboard room.   Already, I was at the door with the elf woman in the 
toga, tripping over my own overly long curtain gown.  
</p><p align=left>
"What is it today?" I asked, trying to decern what this was all about. 
</p><p align=left>
"How could you have forgotten? Today we're playing Shift! I tell you, dear,
you have to most *horrid* memory around. But, we've already captured some
souls, and the others are floating around in the elements. Of course, the
bodies will die soon, but then we'll just flip back, and all will be well!"
</p><p align=left>
"I must have missed the details last time," I said to the woman, and her
eyes widened in shock. 
</p><p align=left>
"You forgot? Oh my. Well, it was last millennium, after all," she said, as
casually as though saying "last week." Now, my people are very long lived
in the standards of humans and demi-humans, but even for High Ogres, or
what passes for them these days, a millennium is more than a bit. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well," she sighed, "*They* came up with it with just before the last
meeting. Anyway, it's a game. We still up the chaos a bit more than we
usually do, look in for people and such like that are floating around, and
switch our souls for theirs. That way, we get to have some fun in the
chaos, and not take any permanent harm from it. We just switch the souls
back right before their bodies die," she smiled at me, "Remember, now?"
</p><p align=left>
Instead of saying "yes" which might have lead her into a discussion of
other facts that I had "misplaced" I sighed, and shook my head negatively. 
</p><p align=left>
"No, I must not have been paying much attention last time."
</p><p align=left>
She aimed a severe look in my direction and said, "You really must stop
that! Anyway, pay attention this time, or you'll miss out on the fun. Some
of us have already started the game."
</p><p align=left>
As we stepped into a long hallway made of transparent  glass, through which
the chaos could be viewed, I realized that was just what had happened to
me. I had switched bodies with one of the red toga people. The questions
were, who were they, what were they, and why hadn't they realized that I
was not one of them, but a switched soul?
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="10"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Ten</u></font>
<p align=left>
The room we entered was made out of something like crystal, except it was
clearer. You could see through it, right into the chaos, which was
currently taking the shape of blazing red molten fire. 
The red clad cutters that filled the room were oohing and ahhing over the
sight, letting of a scream of laughter every once and a while. The red
shone into the room like weird alternate realities in some barmy's
shattered mind, flickering and swirling all around me. The elf woman smiled
into the lava view as she skipped over the to one of her toga friends. The
other, who was a fiend of some sort, which I would have been alarmed about
if this all wasn't so totally surreal, looked over at the elf, and greeted
her with an astonishing eagerness. Huh? Correct me if I'm wrong, but most
elves just don't get along with the natives of lower Planes, but either
this one was a great actor, or they were the exceptions to the rule. 
</p><p align=left>
"Who is flying now?" I heard the elf saying. 
</p><p align=left>
"Gerui, of course. The leatherheaded basher jumped into the first body that
came along, swearing all the while he'd get out in time. Of course, he
won't. He never does," the fiend pronounced disdainfully. 
</p><p align=left>
The elf laughed in contemptuous agreement, even as she sneered haughtily
"Perhaps we should simply leave him this time."
</p><p align=left>
"I've been saying that same thing for millenium, but he's got a "rapport"
with the high-ups, and what cutter worth his power's gonna argue with
that?" the fiend question, rhetorically. 
</p><p align=left>
"True," the elf agreed, "but I simply cannot see why they humor him to
begin with."
</p><p align=left>
The fiend stood still for a long moment, staring into the fire, before he
said, "Well, it's been said that the dark of it is--mind you, I'm not sure
on this, see, but I've heard it may true--that Gerui's the Imperitor's
great-nephew. The high-ups are real big on family, so they won't let 
anyone slip him in the dead-book. If anyone's scribing him that, it'll be
them. Course, this is all heresay, you know."
</p><p align=left>
The elf was rolling her eyes, even as she responded, "Right, Heres. You
have ten rumors for every mystery to be solved."
</p><p align=left>
"I say what I hear, nothing more."
</p><p align=left>
An exasperated huff escaped the woman, and then she shrugged. I, however,
seemed to have been completely forgotten, which kinda puzzled me, seeing as
the elf seemed something of a social butterfly. There was no time to
question the situation, however, before the view through the crystal
changed form fire, to solid ice. And I do mean solid. Whatever was keeping
the lava from melting through was not working on this stuff. It completely
surrounded the place, shoving forward with a pressure that I could feel
throughout my body, right before a long crack snaked through the crystal,
and groan sounded all around me. A long scream sounded,  but it
seemed oddly insincere, and the toga people seemed unaware that anything
was happening. They just kept chatting it up, and sipping their red drinks.
Myself, I was not so calm, but trying to appear as such. If they thought
there was nothing to worry about, I did not want to look like I was
worried, and blow my unwitting disguise. 
</p><p align=left>
And then, things really went to the Abyss when the fiend looked up and
announced, "He's back," just before a bright red light flashed in the air,
and thud hit the floor, and then, I was looking at my own body.
</p><p align=left>
Long limbed, sharp featured, and sapphire blue skinned, dressed in spider
silk and chainmail, that was me. Lying there on the floor, frost all over
me, looking as dead as dead gets, just before my body jumped up to my. .
..it's feet and shouted in my own voice, "She's in here somewhere! She has
to be!" 
</p><p align=left>
"What in Baator!?" the fiend exclaimed, it's dark and gravely voice
sheering like steel through the room in it's shock. 
</p><p align=left>
"The woman. She's taken Leyla's body," the thing in my body exclaimed. 
</p><p align=left>
"What are you talking about?" the elf woman idly, question, voice bored.
</p><p align=left>
"I mean that there is someone in this room who is not one of us, but seems
to be. I saw her switch places with Leyla when I was leaving my own body,"
the thing explained, even as I backed steadily away, trying to be as quiet
as possible. I didn't know for sure, but I had a pretty good hunch that
this toga clad thing I was in was the body of Leyla, whoever she was.
Turned out, I was right. Dozens of pairs of eyes turned on me in an
instant, and the elf woman muttered, "I knew there was something strange
about her." Ya right, I thought in return to her statement. You were
Clueless. 
</p><p align=left>
Too little, too late my escape efforts came, as the whole tackily glad
gathering surged forward, smoothing right before my eyes into long black
lines and shimmering sparkles, and very, very sharp teeth and claws. I
shouldn't have been shocked, but I was. I'd never seen anything like this
before, and it setting my senses into low-drive. A moment later, I thought
to actually run, but it was already too late, as those self-same very, very
sharp teeth and claws ripped very, very, painfully into my surrogate body.
I screamed painfully as I moved to draw my weapons, and then realized that
"surrogate body" meant it wasn't really mine, and thus, that *my* weapons
were not on me. 
</p><p align=left>
So, I screamed some more. It just was not my week, I thought, even as I
heard the basher in my body screaming "No, no, you leatherheads, you're
killing Leyla's body!" and the sounding of falling ice, and crashing
crystal echoed. And then I fell to the floor under the razor edges slashing
at me, flailing uselessly at the ethereal black streaks they extended from.

<p align=left>
It was a dark cocoon, like ink. Except, not as messy. Well, not as sticky.
Or something. Indescribable in it's own way. They covered me with their
beings, seeping into my pores, into my mind. And I into theirs. There was
only chaos at first, chaos swirling here and there, all around, colours and
shapes, and things that cannot be described, because they are so chaotic,
so out of order, there is nothing to compare them to. And then, slowly,
slowly, the images came. Sigil, there was, and a conflict. There were
factions members all over the place, and I could see even those that did
not wear any identifiers. Arguing, and whirlwinds of trouble and chaos, and
conflict. And then, some other faction members. . .Xaositects, screaming,
laughing, silent, still as statues, running hard and fast, laying in the
offal that had dropped from the body of something. Scatching at faces, and
licking the blood out of wounds, floating on air and giggling like
children, dictating to the worlds the meaning of chaos and life. And a
portal, opening, into the chaos of Limbo, a group of some twenty Xaositects
jumping right into the chaos, some dying, but most living. Adaptation to
the chaos did not take much for them, and soon, they were as much a part of
it as the all too mutable landscape. They were. . .observed. Living for
thousands upon thousands of years. I can't say I'm not envious about *that*
part. Or the not dying when hit over the head with thousand pound chucks of
rock, and sliced to bits by falling ice. There are some benefits to
throwing yourself in chaos. So, basically, I gathered from the helpful
look-see into their swirly minds, they gather together, every once and a
while, to exchange notes, and promote more chaos by creating the irony of
the crystal thing. Some would say that it was order in chaos. Apparently,
these beings take the view that nothing truly chaotic would disdain
anything in the further pursuit of chaos. Believe me, I don't pretend to
understand it. As far as I see it, chaos is chaos. 
</p><p align=left>
Which beings us right up the fact of my dropping into the ice filled air,
and the body I was borrowing dissolving into water, freezing, and then
shattering. Trust me, it *is* as painful--more even--than it sounds. And
then I shattered right down into the blazing fire, ice chips melting into
water, water turning into steam, steaming swirling in the air, trying to
scream, and not have a mouth to do so with. Damn, but I never want to go
through anything like that again. Never wanted to to begin with. 
</p><p align=left>
And then I was swirling around, seeing nothing and hearing nothing, and
tasting nothing, and yet, doing all these things at once. And then, I was
slammed into a body, solid, and looked down to see chain mail, and spider
silk. A giggle, female and delighted rent the air, and I somehow knew--not
to sound hokey or anything, cause I know that is what it sounds like--but I
just knew that the Limbo being who's "body" I had been in had returned to
her own--and was enjoying her steam trip as nothing ever before. Huh. What
a cutter--barmier than a clueless Prime running to the Abyss for adventure.
</p><p align=left>
I looked around--and saw stone--stone and ice and fire, but mostly stone.
The ice and fire was further up--or down. Or something. I wasn't exactly in
my right bearings at the moment, if ya know what I mean. 
</p><p align=left>
I heard a slight sound of swishing robes, and then the wizard, Freqtw,
looking quiet angry, and very cold, seeing as half of him was frosted over
with winter dew, was scowling in my face. And then,  and there was no
warning at all for this part--the drow was suddenly behind the wizard,
asking the question I held as well, in a slightly more--forceful manner. 
</p><p align=left>
"Teleport us out of this realm, or I shall ripe your heart from your
chest," and he looked as though he *really* meant it. 
</p><p align=left>
The wizard scowled and tried to tug out of the grip the drow had on him,
but it was a no go. He was well and truly caught. 
</p><p align=left>
"I can't. I used the only teleport spell I memorized lately to transport
myself into the room where I had the Ogre holed up. It wouldn't be powerful
enough to carry two people out of here anyway."
</p><p align=left>
"Two people?!,' I exclaimed, "What about you?"
</p><p align=left>
"What about me? I'd be the other person,' said the wizard, "Don't think
I'll do anything other than kill you, now. If only I had a container. I
don't want that Ogre blood to go to waste."
</p><p align=left>
"You are not killing her. You are going to find a portal out of here," said the drow. 
</p><p align=left>
"Haven't you ever been to Limbo, before?" the wizard asked the warrior. 
</p><p align=left>
"Yes. I have. But there were different circumstances."
</p><p align=left>
"What?"
</p><p align=left>
The drow hesitated for a moment, and then seemed to shrug, apparently not
caring if the wizard knew whatever it was, "I had just arrived on the
Planes. I was a Clueless."
</p><p align=left>
The wizard nodded then, and said "Aaah. I see. Well, how did you get out then?"
</p><p align=left>
"I had the assistance of one of the natives. I upset one of them, and
another, not liking it's fellow native, opened a portal for me, into Sigil,
just to spite the other."
</p><p align=left>
"Oh. I don't suppose you would want to repeat that? No, I didn't' think
so," said the wizard, answering his own question. "Hmm. I don't know of any
portals."
</p><p align=left>
"Then I suppose we shall simply have to find one, hmm?" questioned the
drow, very rhetorically, and then, as an afterthought, smiled and said,
"With the Ogre."
</p><p align=left>
It seemed the Limbo people weren't the only ones who liked the indulge in
spite. Zaknafein Do'Urden did not seem to enjoy the fact that the wizard
was just as Clueless on the matter of how to get out of Limbo as I, the
drow himself, and so many others were. 
</p><p align=left>
I could see it was going to be a long journey. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="12"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Twelve</u></font>
<p align=left>
Someone giggled. Now, I'm not even going to ask to be corrected if I'm
wrong, because I know that I am right-- the drow was not at all the type to
giggle. As to the wizard, even if he did indulge in a mad giggle fit upon
occasion, he certainly did not seem to be in the mood at the moment. 
But someone was giggling. I opened my mouth to ask just where the sound
could have come from when I noticed that neither of my companions was
speaking, or, indeed, moving. They seemed frozen in place, staring ahead at
the--for lack of better word--horizon. 
</p><p align=left>
Without warning, a huge hand, long and silver skinned, descended from the
"sky," moving to scoop me up, it seemed. Alarmed--okay, more like
incredulous and outright panicy by this point in time --I darted away from
it's reach, nimbly avoiding the giant hand. No sooner had I accomplished
this, however, when another joined it, and another, and another, and, well
you pretty much get the picture, hmm?
</p><p align=left>
So, I was scooped up in the hand jumble, as I poked and stabbed at the
things with a couple daggers I'd drawn from their places upon my person.
Unfortunately, to the hands, they had far less effect than even a common
tack would have upon my own hands. Soon enough, all of those fingers were
tightening, closing me into a thoroughly unpleasant, hot, stuffy, fleshy
prison. 
</p><p align=left>
I fell to yet another checkered marble floor when the hands dumped me to
the ground. Dazed, I looked around, finding faces all around myself,
grinning, scowling, laughing, crying, doing anything and everything you
could think off, all there in that room. 
</p><p align=left>
Sharply, I looked over when someone nudged me roughly in the shoulder. 
</p><p align=left>
"What?!" I snapped, expecting to find another one of the barmies from this
party, and instead finding the scowling face of the Dustman wizard, Freqtw.
Huh? I just saw this man dwindle to a speck on the ground, even as my view
was being obscured my giant hands. This did not make sense. 
</p><p align=left>
"What do you mean what? I was just shuffled through more chaos than I ever
wanted to know and all you can say is what? You're worse than the drow. All
he does ignore me, or make threatening comments whenever I say I don't know
where there's a gate. Nothing too threatening, of course. Just vague stuff
that warns me not to go out of his sight, and don't we all know that. Of
course, you had to disappear, and here I was waiting for the chance to fill
me jars. But of course, I can't because my jars are in Sigil. In my home,
where we left when you had to bump into the damn wall. And the drow did
that for you, though,. didn't he? So, I hate you both. Don't expect a good
word from me. I'm just warning you in advance," I gapped as he turned away
with a flick of his scraggly hair, wondering why he was acting as though we
hadn't just meant five minutes before, and the drow, too. And what's this
"vague" stuff? Ripping a person's heart out never sounded like vague threat
to me? And why should I care whether the wizard hated me? Okay, eventually,
he could make trouble for me, yes, but I had a bit more to worry about now
than a wizard hating me. 
</p><p align=left>
A light touch to my shoulder sent me spinning around, facing the drow who
had suddenly appeared. 
</p><p align=left>
"He's been like this for the past four days," he said with a slight grin. 
</p><p align=left>
"Why is he with you at all?" I snapped. 
</p><p align=left>
"Have you forgotten so soon what got us three into this situation?" he
inquired archly. 
</p><p align=left>
Huh? I stared blankly for a moment, and then it all rushed back to me. Oh
right. The Dustmen wanted to control the undead, and this drow was some
sort of new type or mutation. 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh. That."
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, that. I need to keep him close on hand because of "that." He still
has the research, hmm."
</p><p align=left>
"Well, he was just holding onto the skin for Kyger, actually."
</p><p align=left>
"Your friend Kyger, I found, has gone on a . . . retreat for some months.
Perhaps even years and will not be back soon. I assume that the researching
has been handed over to Freqtw. If not, I shall deal with that later."
</p><p align=left>
"What?' I hissed in sudden outrage. I don't like Kyger, yes, but-"How is he
supposed to pay me, then?!"
</p><p align=left>
"I assume he has other things on his mind."
</p><p align=left>
"Why that two bit, hardskulled, cross trading idiot!" I muttered furiously.
</p><p align=left>
"We have other things on our mind, currently, as well. Such as Limbo."
</p><p align=left>
"Right. Limbo. Well, how are we supposed to get out?"
</p><p align=left>
"Freqtw says that he does not know of any gates about, and neither do I."
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, yes. That's what you said earlier."
</p><p align=left>
"What?" he looked rather startled. 
</p><p align=left>
"You know. Earlier, when you said the last time you had been here, you were
Clueless."
</p><p align=left>
"I said no such thing. I have not seen you since we three were first
separated."
</p><p align=left>
"Of course you did. It was just--"
</p><p align=left>
"I didn't," his voice was cold and uncompromising.
</p><p align=left>
"Silly Ogre," Freqtw, having suddenly approached, sneered. "Limbo can turn
the mind inside out. Who is to say that this very moment you are not just
dreaming."
</p><p align=left>
The drow drew his eyes into thin slits, and the wizard smiled smugly at me,
and the people all around us started to break their span of ignoring our
presence, and then, a dwarf stepped forward, black bearded and red-haired,
green eyed, and wearing a tunic and trousers formed--of all things--worms.
Ugh. 
</p><p align=left>
"This is the mind. You three are linked in the mind," he said, solemn and
grave and menacing.
</p><p align=left>
Oh boy. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="13"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Thirteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
I can't say I enjoyed his fashion sense much, but then, there's no
accounting for taste . I smiled, put a hand on my right hip, and said, 
</p><p align=left>
"Well, for the moment now, all I can hear is my own mind, thank you very
much."
</p><p align=left>
The dwarf grimaced, snorted, and said, "You would not hear their minds. You
are connected for a task. Our task. You have been summoned here, to our
abode."
</p><p align=left>
"Summoned! I was not summoned. I see no sigils of summoning here, and I was
not pulled away to here," Freqtw snorted. 
</p><p align=left>
The dwarf shook his head, almost seeming sad that we just did not
understand. Truly, what a tragedy, my sarcasm shines. A worm slithered up
from his collar, curled around his neck, slithered onto his face, and poked
it's head into his mouth. I resisted the urge to hurl my guts. 
</p><p align=left>
"Just because there are no signs, does not mean the summoning is not
truth," the dwarf said, "I am Gerted Liltet, Lady of the Bertay, splinter
faction of the Chaosmen."
</p><p align=left>
Lady? Well, I never could tell the difference between dwarf genders, but
still, the "Lady" looks an awful lot like a male. A splinter faction of the
Chaosmen was not too surprising, though. They are so chaotic, most wouldn't
care, and the others wouldn't notice. Still, it's rare that they actually
call themselves Chaosmen, which was not their formal name. Then again, why
should they care about formalities? Then again [again] , why would they go
through the trouble of actually splitting to begin with? The--well, there
were lots of questions to the whole matter, and not very many answers as of
that point. 
</p><p align=left>
The dwarf nodded as though we had said something, and I realized with a
start that the drow had, the first he had said to those people. The
statement caught up with me a moment later. 
</p><p align=left>
"For what do you believe we have been summoned?" there was an ironic twist
to Zaknafein's words, which, judging from wry glances exchanged between the
Chaosmen, ah, Bertay, was certainly clear. 
</p><p align=left>
"It is good that you ask this," the dwarf answered, fingers brushing
absently against the slimy mucas that dripped from the worms on her coat.
Once again, I worked to bring my stomach under control. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well?" I tried urged her, seeing as the dwarf did not seem to be moving
along to the point anytime soon. 
</p><p align=left>
"Oh, yes. You are obviously capable beings, none could survive even this
long in our region and not be capable, but you were caught up in the mind. 
That's what all that confusion was about, earlier. You didn't really
meet your companions, then," somehow, despite that fierce expression, and
menacing stance, worm formed coat, and drawn down eyebrows, the dwarf
actually managed to sound, of all things, motherly. "We were testing you,"
she continued, "Of course, each of you experienced something different."
</p><p align=left>
I wonder what my "companions" experienced?
</p><p align=left>
"But you are deemed strong enough to help us."
</p><p align=left>
"How very pleasant for us," Zaknafein remark rather sourly. 
</p><p align=left>
"It is," the dwarf nodded eagerly.  
</p><p align=left>
"So, what are we supposed to do?" the wizard asked, seeming genuine
curiosity colouring his voice
</p><p align=left>
"Well, you see," she started, for all the world seeming as though she were
talking to a group of long lost friends.  "Our ancestors split from the
Chaosmen some fifty thousand years ago, in the time when the rulership of
the Lady of Pain was disputed, and fought over. We enjoyed the chaos, of
course, but there seemed something so impure about it, seeing as they were
fighting for order. We wanted a more primal  essence to immerse ourselves
in, and so we migrated to Limbo. Many died, of course, but some survived,
and we slowly but steadily adapted ourselves to the environment, gaining
longer lives as we became creatures more connected to our surroundings.
Only four generations have passed in the intervening time."
</p><p align=left>
Four generations in fifty thousand years? Wow! Sign me up any day. . . .
</p><p align=left>
"However, in that time, our connection to our surroundings have become more
dulled, our connection to chaos itself less intense, until now many among
us, myself included, actually enjoy carving order, such as the crystal
bubble, and these bodies themselves. We are not as we appear."
</p><p align=left>
"This is all very interesting," Zaknafein interrupted in a tone that said
he felt anything but, "But what does it have to do with us?"
</p><p align=left>
"We need you three to lend us your souls, so that we may compare our own,
and thus be shocked back into the chaos, as we see the loathsome state of
enforced order that we would be forced into, should our devolving state of
being continue any further than it already has," and the "dwarf" grinned,
not at all concerned with the sudden blank hardness that fell upon the dark
elf's face, a prelude to something, no doubt. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=50% align=center>
<a name="14"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Fourteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
There were no more words to be said, and that was a fact. I barely had time
to blink before the drow lunged forward in a lightening quick movement,
right hand sword extended through the air, and then--through the "dwarf's"
neck. The head toppled to the ground, an almost comical expression of shock
spreading across it. The room erupted into shocked exclamations and
flurries of activity as the Bertay jumped forward towards the head,
exclaiming over it, whilst the eyes of the thing opened as wide as they
could possibly go, and more besides. It was definitely time to make a
strategic exit.  A long hand grabbed at my shoulder, pulling me along
towards the cavernous corridor that ran behind us, out of sight. I turned,
almost stumbling in my haste, reaching behind me to pull along the wizard.
And so we ran, in chain fashion, zig zagging up the corridor, as the whole
building bent and shaped itself around us, pushing us here and there, and
everywhere. Reality bent, tilted--and stayed that way. Suddenly, there was
no where left to go. The walls were closing in. Red and black and blue and
white, marble of every shape and size and shade of those colours, solid as
the stones they were. Just as I was about to give up for good, say my
good-byes to the world, so to speak, a blazing white light enveloped me
whole. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 width=25% align=center>
<p align=left>
I was on my knees, in surrender to my heaving stomach. What the worm view
had not accomplished, the light had. I wondered for a moment, somewhat
wryly, if I was dead. After all, had not some particularly brainwashed
individuals reported a "bright light to salvation?" Perhaps they weren't so
brainwashed after all. The next moment, I was chortling in self-mocking
amusement. Even if it was the truth, I myself would by no means be entering
the pearly gates. 
</p><p align=left>
Voices intruded upon my rather self-absorbed wallowing in misery. 
</p><p align=left>
"Haven't we been here, before, weapon master?" an unfamiliar, musical voice
inquired. 
</p><p align=left>
"I think we have," Zaknafein's voice, just as wryly amused at the unknown
one, answered. 
</p><p align=left>
"Where are we?" asked the wizard, rather bluntly, but then I figure he was
tired of being pulled about the planes like a sac of potatoes. Frankly, so
was I. 
</p><p align=left>
"In my study. If you'll assist your friend from the floor, there, I'll have
the mess cleaned up, and we can things further."
</p><p align=left>
"Sounds good to me," Freqtw muttered, too wearied to even protest to being
my friend as he walked over and hauled me up--none too gentle, of
course - by my arm. In return, I hauled my arm away from him, straightened, smoothed my
hair, and tried to maintain some semblance of dignity.
Unfortunately for me, dignity had been in short supply, of late. 
</p><p align=left>
"I regret I cannot offer you a change of clothing," the unknown voice said
to me, and apparently to Freqtw, I gathered by glancing at the wizard's
robe front, soiled at it was by the contents of his stomach. Zaknafein was
looking--well, just as good as ever. I imagine undead don't throw up very
often. "But," our host, who was completely covered in black robes, not an
inch of skin visible,  continued, "I can offer you water with which to
wash," he said, gesturing to several basins upon a nearby table. I raised
an inquiring eyebrow, and the man gave a chuckle, understanding my
bemusement. 
</p><p align=left>
"I keep them on hand when I transport people as I did you. It tends to
upset a great many stomachs."
</p><p align=left>
"I'll bet," I muttered, trudging over to the bowl, grabbing up the wash
cloth, and setting to work. 
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=25%>
<p align=left>
"Why did you save us?" Zaknafein questioned our host, a drow mage, who's
name, I had learnt, was Jalynfein. 
</p><p align=left>
"I was always fond of you. Even after you--departed--our dear world, I kept
checked an eye in on you, every once and while. I keep track of my allies,
former or not."
</p><p align=left>
"So it is that," Zaknafein mused.
</p><p align=left>
We were sitting in a semi-circle or large, comfortable chairs, in the drow
wizard's "living room," and I was quickly gathering the feeling that I was
listening in on a conversation I knew nothing about. Judging from the
somewhat bored, somewhat bemused look upon Freqtw's face, the human wizard
shared my feelings. 
</p><p align=left>
"I hope," Zaknafein added, "That you intend to transport us elsewhere, as
well. It is hardly safe to remain. . .*here.*" He grimaced with the last
word, gesturing in a vaguely outward motion. 
</p><p align=left>
"That is true," the drow wizard noted impassively. "I worked on the spur of
the moment. It is a lucky thing for you that I glimpsed you in that
situation, else I suspect you would already be part of the walls. As it
was, it was very difficult and complicated indeed to bring you from the
other plane. It took a combination of a summoning and a teleportation. But
I made a new discovery about the spell in the process, so all is not lost.
. . . ." he trailed off, musing, apparently engrossed in whatever he had
discovered about the magic. 
</p><p align=left>
"Okay," I spoke up at that opening, "Just where *are* we, anyway?"
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein gazed silently from behind that black mask of cloth and hood for
a long moment, and then he spoke, 
</p><p align=left>
"You are upon the Prime Material world of Toril, in the drow city of
Menzoberranzan."
</p>

<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Fifteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
"Ah, ya. I'll be honest with you, and say that I've never heard of the
place," I spoke bluntly. 
</p><p align=left>
The drow mage made as if to say something, but Zaknafein spoke first. 
</p><p align=left>
"It's my homeworld. And city."
</p><p align=left>
"I see," I responded, "And just why is it, then, that it's dangerous for
you to be here?"
</p><p align=left>
"You obviously don't know much about drow if you think it's safe to be in
any dark elf city," he responded wryly. "But, to cut to the heart of the
matter, those who live in this city have very good reason to think me dead.
Most did not regret my passing."
</p><p align=left>
"So basically, you should be getting out of here," Freqtw said.
</p><p align=left>
"However did you deduce that?" Zaknafein inquired, somewhat sourly. A
moment later, and he was all business, though, turning to inquire of
Jalyfein, "I have made my way out of the Sorcere before, unnoticed, but
with two others, neither drow, I could not do it unaided. Will you help us?"
</p><p align=left>
"Of course," the wizard said. "I did not save your lives, just to let you
rot in my study, or have you destroyed in being discovered. I do not have
many platforms set up nearby, but there is one which would take you to
another city where you would be, at least, safer than you are in
Menzoberranzan."
</p><p align=left>
"Which city is this?"
</p><p align=left>
"Skullport," the wizard said. 
</p><p align=left>
"I've been there once," Zaknafein noted impassively. 
</p><p align=left>
"Good. Then you know something of it. I can transport you there, you and
your friends as soon as I recover my energy. Normally, a set transporter
stone would not need my personal involvement, but this one is different. I
don't use the Skullport stone very often, and would not want to be
discovered. There are more people in that city than usually surround my
stones, you see. And so I keep the stone only as half a focusing point, a
device by which to pin point location."
</p><p align=left>
"How soon?"
</p><p align=left>
"Without sleep, roughly twelve hours. Until then, you're stuck here, unless
you wish to try and walk out of the tower," Jalynfein said, laying out our
options deadpan. 
</p><p align=left>
"I think we'll wait."
</p><p align=left>
"I thought you would," he looked as though he were about to say something
more, when a heavy knock sounded upon the door to his study, and a voice
called out, 
</p><p align=left>
"Master Jalynfein, you are summoned in all haste to the gathering," the
voice was the melodious chime of an elf, the stiff voice of an attendant,
and the smoky darkness of a drow, all in one, a rather difficult
combination to pull off, I would say.
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein froze, perhaps wondering if the elf outside the door had heard
overheard anything, perhaps affronted in being approached so.
</p><p align=left>
"I shall be there presently," he responded in an a voice so icy cold that
it would freeze the marrow's of any creature with half a box on their
shoulders. That voice meant danger, and the berk on the other side of the
door knew it. 
</p><p align=left>
"Of course, Master Jalynfein," the attendant spoke in faint voice. 
</p><p align=left>
"Leave," Jalynfein ordered. 
</p><p align=left>
"I am sorry, Master Jalynfein," said the other, suddenly not sounding sorry
at all.  Sounding smug, actually. "But I have orders to remain here and escort you."
</p><p align=left>
"I do not require an escort."
</p><p align=left>
"But the Master of the Tower insists."
</p><p align=left>
Even through that impenetrable face covering, you could tell that the wizard was scowling.
</p><p align=left>
"Wait in the coat room," Jalynfein spoke curtly. 
</p><p align=left>
"As you say, sir."
</p><p align=left>
Soft, barely audible footsteps retreated from the door, eventually trailing off completely. 
</p><p align=left>
"Despite the reclusive state of the tower, it seems that the so-called
Master of Sorcere has decided that I do not attend plotting and scheming
sessions nearly so often as I should. You will have to remain here. Don't
leave the study, and you should be fine until I return."
</p><p align=left>
"Summoned to a gathering," Zaknafein murmured with a half amused smile. 
</p><p align=left>
"Indeed," Jalynfein said sourly, gathering his cloak from the large desk
chair, and walking out the door. It shut with a bang, leaving the three of
us sitting silently, very silently in the study. 
</p>
<a name="16"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Sixteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
The silence was deafening. Not literally, of course, but still. . . .
Freqtw was glaring at the walls, no doubt wishing that he'd never seen my
face, Zaknafein's face, Kyger's face, anyone's face. I could understand,
but hardly sympathize. After all, this was the man who'd wanted to bottle
my blood to ward his room. 
</p><p align=left>
"Are we just going to wait?" he finally demanded. 
</p><p align=left>
Leatherhead idiot. What the hell else were we supposed to do? Zaknafein,
seemingly lounging in a chair, but likely ready to move at the slightest
provocation, directed a sneer over at the human. 
</p><p align=left>
"Of course not. We're going to go out into the hallway, which is no doubt
watched by a dozen spies and wardings at any time of the day, walk through
Sorcery, a drow, an "Ogre" and a human, and everyone will simply let us go
upon our way, never suspecting a thing," he snapped sarcastically. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw huffed his breath out, and glared more at the walls. Apparently, the
cheerful carelessness the wizard had displayed to me upon occasion had ran
out.
</p><p align=left>
An brilliant flash of light exploded in the outer room, followed by a thud
up against the study door, as of something meaty slapping onto a flat
surface. A jabber of two voices intruded upon the sound, arguing between
themselves. Zaknafein was up on his feet then, melting into the shadows,
beside the door, gesturing us to move as well. Freqtw chanted low under his
breath, readying a spell, whilst I bared one of my numerous daggers, taking
up a place on the other side of the door. 
</p><p align=left>
I couldn't understand what the people on the outside where saying, as they
were speaking an unfamiliar language. The wizard Jalynfein had spoken
Planar Common, but apparently these people had no such knowledge, or at
least, didn't oblige to speak it at the moment. 
</p><p align=left>
A shuffling sounded as though they were moving the body--I assumed the
sound was a body--and then the door was being poked at. Zaknafein gave a
barely perceptible shift, Freqtw moved forward ever so slightly, and I
tensed just as the door opened. 
</p><p align=left>
Two drow elves slipped in, and made to look about for inhabitants.
Unfortunately for them, there was several. Zaknafein exploded forward in a
blur of motion, a whip suddenly appearing his hand, snapping around the
feet of the lead drow, knocking him to the floor with a sudden thud. I
rushed forward, and clubbed the second drow with the hilt of my dagger. The
elf's eyes opened wide, but the berk wasn't right down, and he made to move
toward me, when Freqtw's spell caught him straight, freezing him in place
where he stood. The elf grimaced. Apparently, this was not how his little
sneak about trip was meant to turn out. I grinned at him, barring my teeth.
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein arranged the two intruders against the wall containing the
fireplace, well away from the place itself, however. There was next to
nothing on this side of the room, and it was best that way. Who knows what
our two "cloak and dagger" companions might get hold of, otherwise?
</p><p align=left>
Flipping back the cloak hood he had donned a moment ago, Zaknafein faced
the two captives directly, drawing a reaction I most certainly did *not*
expect. Their eyes went as wide as saucers, and the one still able to move
made to run, an attempt which was aborted with another crack of the weapon
master's whip. When he hit the floor again, the prime began to babble
something frantically, and quiet incredulously, which Zaknafein answered
curtly. The answer did not appear satisfactory. For some twenty minutes,
the impromptu interrogation continued. Finally, Zaknafein nodded, directed
one final warning look at the two and moved away. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well?" I demanded. 
</p><p align=left>
"They are in the employ of another wizard who is quiet jealous of
Jalynfein. They were intended to steal certain items whilst both their
master, and the Spider Mage are at this "meeting." Their companion tripped
a warding and was charred in a flash of fire."
</p><p align=left>
"What was all that gapping and shock when they say you?" I asked. 
</p><p align=left>
"As I said, it's a fact to this city that I am dead. It's rather a shock to
see your former Academy Teacher in the flesh after knowing this fact."
</p><p align=left>
"You were their teacher?"
</p><p align=left>
"Yes. Apparently they were not so fond of me," there was a dry edge to his voice. 
</p><p align=left>
"Apparently," I muttered, looking at the two drow who were eyeing Zaknafein
like he was an approaching poisonous snake, and they helpless as babes. 
</p><p align=left>
Freqtw walked to the study door and peered out, then, just as the outer
door opened, and Jalynfein walked in, voice floating ahead of him. 
</p><p align=left>
"I guess it's true what they say about temptation."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>

<a name="17"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Seventeen</u></font>
<p align=left>
"What's that?" Freqtw asked. 
</p><p align=left>
"A figure of speech," Jalynfein said wryly, "Simply that there are wizards
who are foolish enough to send in their toadies when I am not here."
</p><p align=left>
"They would have gotten in to whatever they wanted if we were not here," I
said irritably. 
</p><p align=left>
"I seldom bother to ward the rooms. Only that one ward for the study. Wards
are inconvenient as I must go through the trouble of taking them down every
time I wish to enter, or I wish a guest to enter. I ward my tools and
possessions themselves. They would have been dead in an instant, had they
tried to steal anything significant. As it is. . .they seem, disturbed."
</p><p align=left>
"I believe they are shocked at my appearance," Zaknafein said.
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein shifted, and gave a sudden, surprising, full-bellied laugh. "Yes,
I guess they would be, at that!" he spoke as those the two intruders were
not sitting at his very feet. 
</p><p align=left>
"When are we leaving?" Freqtw asked. 
</p><p align=left>
"I was called back by the alarm the would-be thieves set off, thank gods.
Those sessions are so tedious. But I am still tired. You will have to wait
some time before you can leave, and I fear that that time will not be a quiet one."
</p><p align=left>
"What do you mean?" Zaknafein asked, rather intensely. 
</p><p align=left>
"The Master of the Academy has decided that it has been too long since he
has visited me. He will be here in several hours. He seemed rather. . .
anxious," Jalynfein eyed the two intruders with a slight smile, and said
to them, "You are going to be my "special guests." We shall see how your
master reacts to sharing tea with you."
</p><p align=left>
The two intruders seemed rather upset at that. 
</p><p align=left>
"Politics," Zaknafein muttered irritably.
</p><p align=left>
"You are not fond?" Jalynfein inquired. I had the feeling that behind his
clothe mask he was grinning sardonically. 
</p><p align=left>
"I am *not.*"
</p><p align=left>
"Well, you won't be a part of it. All three of you must stay out of sight
again, obviously. Which may not be easy. He likes to poke around, so you'll
have to keep ahead of him."
</p><p align=left>
"Yes, well," Freqtw muttered, "That's all very well and good, but we are
leaving when he leaves, right?"
</p><p align=left>
"I should be refreshed enough by then, yes. You seem impatient."
</p><p align=left>
"This place is. . .stifling. I think the whole city would be like that. It
just seems so," the human wizard said in a strange, contemplative tone, as
though he were half asleep.
</p><p align=left>
"I never did think of it as that before, but it seems fitting," Zaknafein
mused in much the same sort of tone. I shifted. Deep philosophy, indeed.
Right.
</p><p align=left>
"Hello! Hey, cutters, this isn't the Hall of Deep Thought! What are we
going to do before the big wig wizard gets here, huh?" I demanded. 
</p><p align=left>
Zaknafein stared at me for a moment, and then burst out into laughter,
clutching his stomach against the sudden barrage of laughter. I eyed him incredulously. 
</p><p align=left>
"It's been quite a while since I've laughed that hard," he gasped out after a
few minutes, and grinned at me in sudden, genuine happiness. It was a
strange scene, and I could only shake my head and say, "You're welcome.  Bunches."
</p><p align=left>
"I'd offer to have us play chess to take up the time, but I think the
giddiness would flood the board," Jalynfein muttered, and sighed in
exasperation as he walked toward his desk.
</p><p align=left>
Around that time the spell that Freqtw had cast upon one of the intruders
wore off, and the elf jumped up, making a run for the door. Casually, I
stuck out a foot, and tripped him over. Unsteady as he was after being held
by the spell, he went down hard. With my heel, I smashed into the back of
his head, knocking him unconscious. 
</p><p align=left>
"Wasn't that a little excessive?" Jalynfein asked, amused, of all things!
</p><p align=left>
"No," I shrugged. What can I say? I just felt like it.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>

<a name="18"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Eighteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
We were sitting in the room which stood beside the study, all three of us.
The two sneak-abouts were in the study with Jalynfein, no doubt looking
for a way out of the situation, whilst they fidgeted under the gaze of the
"Master of the Tower," the elf whom Jalynfein seemed to more than suspect
of having hired them. Ah, tedious intrigue. How I hate it. There was a
crack in the wall which allowed us the listen in on the conversation, so we
knew when to move along, so as to avoid the notice of the master wizard.
Freqtw was pouting in the corner, sulking about how he wanted to return to
Sigil. He wasn't speaking loudly, of course, but his mutters were clear to
my ears, and to Zaknafein's as well from the annoyed grimaces that crossed
his face every once and a while. 
</p><p align=left>
I leaned my ear against the opening in the wall, straining to hear what
they were saying, but the words that came through were a meaningless
babble. Of course. The language thing again.  Sigh. 
</p><p align=left>
"Zaknafein," I hissed, low voiced, "I don't know a word of drow, so unless
we want to be discovered, you should come over here and listen."
</p><p align=left>
He looked up from his grimacing, a startled look upon his face, and I
realized in a moment that it was the first time I'd called him by his name.
</p><p align=left>
"Yes," he said after a moment, "That is true enough," and he grinned as
though it were a joke. I hate not being in on jokes taking place around me,
especially when they are most likely directed towards something *I* did.
It's like walking into a room, and finding everyone laughing. It makes you
wonder what is so funny. 
</p><p align=left>
He walked over the crack, and placed his ear to it, an intent look upon his
face, and I took up his former seat, across from Freqtw. No doubt,
grimaces were soon crossing my face as well. The wizard could be so annoying. 
</p><p align=left>
And then Zaknafein jumped up soundlessly, pulled the wizard to his feet,
and gestured me along towards the next room. It was time to move. We pulled
the door shut behind us. This was Jalynfein's bedchamber. No doubt they
would not be coming in here. I spared a moment to wonder why we hadn't come
in here to begin with, and then I heard the door from the study open, and
went silent, standing stalk still as the vague sound of chatter babbled
from the other side. 
</p><p align=left>
A sudden bash into the door put me on edge, and then the wood was busting
in, screams were sounding from the outside, and godsbedamned, black
tendrils and swirling mounds of earth, blobs of flesh, and tongues of fire
were pouring through the door into Jalynfein's rather pristine bedchamber.
Zaknafein slashed one of his swords through the flesh blobs, a scream
without a mouth sounded, and then he was pulling at my arm, pushing me
along as he kicked in the door at the back of the wizard's bedchamber. Fire
was flashing through the air, both Jalynfein and the visiting master
wizard, and then, in a moment more, Freqtw, were throwing spells through the
air. The two sneak-abouts were creeping the shadows, and though I might
just possibly be inclined to believe that they were looking for an opening,
it wasn't to hit the things, that was sure. They were headed toward the
more correctly shaped of us, and excuse me for my "political
incorrectness," but I never did have the greatest manners. 
</p><p align=left>
I was in the next room, then, and instead of a normal looking, well, *room*
it was a seemingly bottomless shaft. Zaknafein did not even hesitate. He
jumped down it, followed a moment later by the other four drow in the area.
I gaped. Where they all suicidal? A strong hand gripped my ankle and
yanked-- *hard.* Freqtw, seemingly in a similar situation, went tumbling
down beside me whilst I scrambled for a handhold. What was going on?! And
then I twisted around, head spinning, hit a sharp edge, and plunge into
darkness. 
</p><p align=left>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=25%>
</p><p align=left>
Unlike Jalynfein's apartments, this place, whatever it was, was not lit by
candle. It was not lit at all. High Ogres do have night vision, but not
nearly so strong as drow night vision must be to live down here all the
time. I could hear voices and see blurry outlines. 
</p><p align=left>
"You, contrary to willowy appearances, are no lightweight, so if you are
awake, I suggest you get on your feet and support your own weight,"
Zaknafein's voice was irritable as he spoke. 
</p><p align=left>
"Where are we?" I asked hoarsely. 
</p><p align=left>
"Every drow must be ready for the day when permission will not be asked to
enter his home," Jalynfein said. "The tunnel leads downwards. We are below
the city."
</p><p align=left>
It took a moment for this to register. I mean, the Underdark idea itself is
bad enough. All that rock above your head, just waiting to fall down in
magical catastrophe, mining errors, earthquakes, and who knows what else.
But, I mean, *under* the Underdark. In the unshaped depths!? That's must
plain crazy! Last minute measures and all. It's really not good. I let out
a low moan of terror just as Zaknafein let my limp form, which he was
supporting by holding me up by my waist, drop to the--floor? 
</p><p align=left>
"Damn it all to the seven blue hells! Did I ask for this!? No! What did I
do to deserve this!?" I moaned aloud. 
</p><p align=left>
"We've enough of it from the human, planar," the unknown drow who, I
assumed, was "Master of Sorcery" snapped, annoyed. 
</p><p align=left>
"What happened up there?" I asked.
</p><p align=left>
"The Limbodians were apparently rather insulted by our rejection. They
found some way to follow us, and are intent upon revenge. We've gotten away
from them for now, but they'll follow," Freqtw, who hadn't said anything
worthwhile in quiet a while, spoke. I moaned again, wishing he'd kept his
damn bone-box shut.
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>

<a name="19"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Nineteen</u></font>
<p align=left>
"So, are we just going to walk around under here or what? I mean, they'll
catch up eventually," I called. 
</p><p align=left>
"Considering the fact that they can mutate themselves, it will happen
sooner than later," Zaknafein apparently agreed, but he kept walking
forward. I hauled myself to my still wobbly feet, lest they get too far out
of sight, and trotted forward to catch up. 
</p><p align=left>
"So, what are we going to do?" I demanded. 
</p><p align=left>
Jalynfein answered, "The Master of Sorcery has volunteered to transport us
to Skullport. There, you'll be out Menzoberranzan, and we'll be able to
transport ourselves back once the Limbo creatures are diverted. They'll
take a while to follow. But we must reach a place where the stone
radiation's are not so strong, first, because they have been known to
interfere, quite fatally, with transportation spells."
</p><p align=left>
"How are they going to be "diverted?" Fretqw grumbled. 
</p><p align=left>
"Banishing spells and so forth. Extra planar creatures who are linked to
their planes of existence can be banished," Jalynfein said. "I'm surprised
you don't know that."
</p><p align=left>
"Of course I know that. Every planar knows that. I don't have any such
spells memorized, however. I work more with the dead, than the living."
</p><p align=left>
"You are a necromancer?" asked the other drow wizard. 
</p><p align=left>
"Yes," Freqtw answered, somewhat haughtily, and then he deflated as he
scowled again. "Though lately I've been wishing I'd chosen another
vocation. That way, I wouldn't have gotten into this situation to begin with."
</p><p align=left>
The Sorcery elf lifted an eyebrow in a "do-tell" sort of gesture. Zaknafein
had his hood down, so his face couldn't be seen, but his posture said that
he wanted to strangle the Dustman. 
</p><p align=left>
"A deal I made with a colleague," Freqtw explained shortly, displaying some
thought, and not really explaining at all. Luckily for him.
</p><p align=left>
At that moment, we emerged into a cavern of sorts, in which the faint
glowing of the stones, the colourful mosses and lichens, and entire off
feeling of the Underdark was missing. 
</p><p align=left>
"This chamber was prepared by several wizards who wished to use magic to
travel without the potential side effects," Jalynfein explained. "There are
several matching chambers in various places about the Underdark. One of the
those is in Skullport, where my travel stone is. I have that in because it
also stabilizes the process somewhat when I so not wish to journey to the
chamber before going."
</p><p align=left>
The Sorcery master wizard gestured for us to gather close, and immediately
began chanting in a low voice, making complicated hand gestures which were
just a bit more dramatic than I thought necessary. 
</p><p align=left>
A moment more, and the world flickered around me, and then -- light consumed us. 
</p><p align=left>
What seemed like a lifetime later, and I was looking around in another
mossless chamber, similar and yet different from the other one. Thankfully,
this time my stomach decided not to dance a jig. 
</p><p align=left>
In the distance, I heard not the silence of the deep Underdark, but a
babble of voices and footsteps. 
</p><p align=left>
"Well," the wizard who had transported us said. "We're here."
</p>
<hr noshade size=3 align=center width=50%>

<a name="20"></a>
<font face="Visitation" color=red><u>Part Twenty</u></font>
<p align=left>
We walked forward towards the noise of the city for some minutes in a muted
silence. Now what? was the question in the air. We were here, and what did
we do. The drow wizards were going to refresh, catch some Z's, banish the
Limbo cutters, and go back to their city? Wizard work never comes cheap,
and I'm no clueless berk to think that this would be any different. They
were after something, and there's no avoiding that. But apparently, they
were going to try. Silence was our language in those moments. Uneasy,
roiling, and nervous. Damn it, but I wished we could just get it all over
with! Unfortunately, it's never that simple. 
</p><p align=left>
"I know a little inn here that isn't too rife with plots and thieves,"
Jalynfein said suddenly, "It will do for our stay."
</p><p align=left>
"Of course, this is Skullport," added the Sorcery Master--and I was just
dying to know his name. I mean, at least when you know a name, you know
something!--"So no place will be pure."
</p><p align=left>
It's not as though I was expecting purity, you'd have to be a leatherhead
to think you'd get that, but weariness settled right in bones at that
statement. All I wanted to do was sleep, sleep, and sleep some more!
Preferably for about a week straight. But my first glimpse of the city of
Skullport completely dispelled that notion. It looked, felt, and smelt
sleazy. Oh sure, it had the mysterious aura part down pat, but it was still
sleazy. There was no way in Baator that I was going to settle down and nap
like a baby here. Light guarded sleeps, sure. Week long hibernation's? No. 
</p><p align=left>
We wove through the beings that populated the place in a long, narrow line.
By no means were we a happy go lucky adventuring party, off to save the
universe single handedly. We were, however, a cobbled together group of
people who were likely to turn on each other at an instant's notice. Maybe
Zaknafein and Jalynfein had encountered each other in the past, but they
also did not seem to be the best of friends either. Wizards as strange, they tend to pick up
fancies. Maybe the mage just made the drow mercenary a project or
something. I don't know, but I do no that there was *not* complete trust
between them. So, there was not complete trust between any of us. 
</p><p align=left>
When we reached the "little inn" in which we were to stay, I understood why
there wouldn't be a great deal of plotting and thieves here. Mainly,
because it was too unpleasant to plot in, and there was nothing to steal.
The place was a broken down, one story, converted apartment containing no
more than five rooms. In inn keeper was a grinning little dwarf who tried
to swindle us for every penny we had. Not that it worked, but still. . .
</p><p align=left>
Finally, though, we were ensconced in our rooms. I shared mine with Freqtw
and Zaknafein, and Jalynfein and the Sorcery berk shared another. I carried
some jink with me, but none that would do the job on this plane, same for
Fretqw and Zaknafein. The drow wizards just hadn't brought much money, so
we were stuck in close quarters. 
</p><p align=left>
The others were no doubt planning to do something about the Limbodians, who
would catch up sooner than later, but I was concerned about one thing.  Sleep. 
</p><p align=left>
*Only a little,* my was last thought before dropping off. 
</p><p align=left>
Famous last words.

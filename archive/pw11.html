My name is Slick D'kantonar. I got the surname because my grandfather
was a fiend, an Marquis Cambion. He bobbed my mother, and made her give birth
to me. I am that legacy. My mother was a great coney catcher, so great, she was
sent to the Mazes. I don't have such great ambition. I just want jink, the more
the better. I bob prime berks, I spy, and I sometimes get paid to put people in
the dead book. My employer is paying me big for this job.  A large bag of jink
up front, and another one when I complete the mission. I looked down at the
berk I'm supposed to spy on. He's some prime berk. Not very large, but he has a
warrior's build. He isn't dressed as a warrior, but he wouldn't get in if he
were. He was wearing a white doublet, and a black vest with black breeches. His
soft boots padded along the street. When he got nearly out of sight, I would
teleport to the next building to watch him. This ability was originally a gift
of my grandfather's through blood, but not too long ago, I lost the ability to
do so. Recently I have been able to, and I am not sure why. I am just glad that
it came back.</p><p align=left>

I easily teleported into the ballroom. I masked myself with my cloak, Cloak of
the Fiend, which allowed me to be invisible, but allows me to see someone who
may be invisible. He looked out of place, the berk. He was dressed in fashion,
but he stuck out. He's a prime, but is not so fearsome without his fiend
slaying sword. I dare not touch it, if I could find a non-fiendish berk to
steal it for me, perhaps we'd be in business. For now, however, I'll watch. The
warrior is standing not talking to anyone, and he's approached by a Rogue
Modron, I got to hear what is said here.</p><p align=left>

"Greetings Blood Warrior. My designation is...correction I mean, my name is
Cyrix."</p><p align=left>

The warrior looked at the mechanical creature and said, "How did you know I'm a
Blood Warrior?"</p><p align=left>

The Modron clicked and scraped "You have the build of a Blood Warrior, on who's
side do you work for, what is it like to be evil? Do you see the nature between
Law and Chaos?"</p><p align=left>

A sharp laugh came from the large haughty Aasimar, his golden skin and pent up
wings would make me think he was an Avoral, but he had too many human features
to be completely Guardinal-like. "Don't mind Cyrix, Rogue Modrons are
especially inquisitive." The Aasimar stands over 6 feet tall, with blonde hair
and green eyes. "By the way Cyrix, our young warrior here radiates good, not
evil."</p><p align=left>

The Modron pinched the warrior by the arm. "He doesn't radiate anything to me."
The large Aasimar laughs again "It's my Guardinal blood which allows me to
detect good and evil Cyrax. Modrons don't seem to have that ability."  
Haughty bastard!  I wonder if I can kill that bastard. "My name is Chandeen,
warrior priest of Ishtar, pleased to meet you." Chandeen? What kind of haughty
bastard name is that?</p><p align=left>

Bane replied "Greetings Chandeen, I am Bane." He held out his hand and the
Aasimar shook it. Maybe my employer will ask me to kill Chandeen instead. This
Blood Warrior doesn't seem too bad. If we bring him to our side he'd be
useful.</p><p align=left>

Bane looked at the Aasimar and the Modron. "Bane, you look like you've never
seen an Aasimar and a Modron before?" Bane replied "I haven't, at least, I
don't think I have." A bluish skinned creature, I believe it's a wind duke,
another haughty bastard, but not as bad as the Aashole. "Bane, it looks like
you met some of our friends." Bane replied "yes I guess I have." The gensai
spoke to the Aasimar "Chandeen, how are things with the Ciphers?" The aashole
replied "Oh things are well. Most of us are concerned about the Modron March
however." The rogue modron made an obvious twitch. Most rogues don't like the
thought of running into the modrons because they are usually found and
destroyed. Sigil is typically a safe place for rogues, and Sigil has become
more and more a haven for them. Those rusty clocks aren't good for anything
except spouting off laws. </p><p align=left>

Bane looked quizzical "Modron March?" The Wind Duke beamed "Ah I figured a
adventurous cutter like Bane would find it of interest! A number of Cyrix's
former kind are marching throughout the planes. They are going much earlier
than expected, and it is causing a lot of chaos." Heh heh, yeah it is
incredibly amusing, all those rickety clocks. Factol Pentar is going to lead a
strike against them. This early appearance caught her off guard. Bane scratched
his chin "Where are they at now?" The gensai replied "The Outlands between
Tradegate and Esctasy. Word is someone is trying to steal modrons during the
march." Bane wide eyed replied "Isn't there something we could do about that?"
That gensai was leading him this way, I can tell. "Why yes there is! We can
ride out and find who is doing this dastardly deed." Bane replied "When?" The
gensai replied "Tomorrow, nothing too exciting could happen 'til then." The
gensai smiled "Besides we couldn't let you lose your chance with Lady
Christine." The Aasimar and the Gensai chuckled.</p><p align=left>

Hmm Lady Christine, excellent, a weak link to Bane. Something I could use
against him. Bane smiled nervously but then looked in my direction, like he
could see me as plain as day. He saw something, which is impossible, since this
cloak can mask me from all but fiends and celestials. The gensai looks into my
direction trying to see what Bane is looking at, but it's obvious that he can't
see me. The aashol looks and doesn't see anything. "Friend Bane, what is it
that you are looking at?"</p><p align=left>

Suddenly Bane leapt at me. I would have teleported but I didn't expect him to
leap. His hand grabbed my throat, I punched the berk, and he hit me with a
powerful punch, keeping me from teleporting away. I pulled out a poisoned
dagger at stabbed at him. The blade slashed his arm, and his fist pounded into
my face again. My dagger caught nothing in the next strike, the third, he broke
my grip of the dagger and stabbed myself with it.</p><p align=left>

The poison splashed through my body. I do have some immunity to poison, but not
enough. I stumble out of his grasp. His foot kicks up and slams into my ribs. I
hear them crack and brake. My body blinks to the front doors where the guards
are oblivious to me. Bane was quickly on me. How can he see me, it's not
possible!  "Stop Him! " Bane yelled. The two guards looked quizzically. I ran
past them, and it didn't matter that they may have heard me pass. Bane rushed
me and leapt onto my back and we both rolled down the marble stairs that lead
up to the Sensorium. Bones broke in both our bodies, until we landed by the
streets. I slowly got to my feet, so did Bane. I kicked him with my cracked
left leg, and it kept him rolling down, but my leg snapped. In order to get
away from the blood warrior, I had to do line-of sight teleport to the rooftop.
The warrior was getting up again. I've never seen someone take this much
punishment since myself. He is a true warrior, but he sees me for what I am, a
fiend. </p><p align=left>

He limped toward me, holding his ribs. There was no way he could reach me, but
to be safe, I looked to a far rooftop and teleported there. There I was fairly
safe. I dropped to the street. My legs hurt painfully from the drop. My legs
were broken, a number of ribs were broken, but I saw my escape, a portal. It
was an easy key to get in. It required blood of an adversary, and Bane's blood
did stain my cloak. I was able to crawl through the entrance, painfully, but
surely. My employers in Gehenna would be very interested in the information I
give to them.</p><p align=left>

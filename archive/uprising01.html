<p align=left>
Another sad day comes about in the City of Doors.  But this time it comes on a scale grander than any 
could have dreamed.  All along the streets of The Lady's Ward, people, most of them Harmonium, lined 
the streets, head hanging in a deathly silence.  At the City's Barracks, a stand was set atop the building, 
and the Lieutenant Factol Barbithka stood, looking down upon the gatherers.  He had tried to come up 
with something to say the previous night, but this event did not deserve mere words.  Still, the public 
waited, and he would deliver.
</p><p align=left>
"My fellows Cagers, a grave atrocity was committed here last evening, one which the city will never 
forget.  Somehow, an assassin made it through every security guard in the building, into our Factol's 
room, and murdered him brutally.  This is an undeniable warning beacon of how low we will go, just to 
make ends meet.  This act is without a doubt, the gravest crime committed in our fair city.
</p><p align=left>
"But if it is any consolation to anyone out there, we have the body of the assassin.  Arctur Bonifest found 
him running away in an attempt to escape last night.  He was caught in a fight, and took several bad 
injuries.  Then he got off a perfect shot, avenging his factol and his faction.  The body will be hung above 
the barracks, to show all that we always get our man.  Now I believe Arctur has something to say."
</p><p align=left>
Barbithka stepped down and exchanged a few sad words with Arctur.  Then he sat down in his chair and 
listened to the emotional sounding words of Arctur.  But he did not know, nor did anyone else, that these 
words were purely false, simply meant for to put him in power.
</p><p align=left>
Arctur looked down at his speech.  He would suck them in, put them into a crying mess, and then deliver 
his plan to put him as factol.
</p><p align=left>
"My fellow citizens," started Arctur.  "My heart hangs heavy with emotion from this grave crime.  I was 
going home last night after a day of deskwork, when I saw this man running away quickly.  Then I heard 
the screams.  I jumped in front, and a fight insued.
</p><p align=left>
"He pulled his sword, and slashed me several times, stunning me.  Figuring that I was out temporarily, he 
turned and fled.  But with very little strength remaining, I pulled out my flintlock which I always have 
pre-loaded, pulled the hammer and fired a shot.  It pierced his lung I assume and he died soon thereafter.
</p><p align=left>
"I looked at me bloody self, and then the guards found me.  They asked me what I would like done with 
the body.  I said, `Hang it to warn all other that we always get our man.'  And so it shall be done now."
</p><p align=left>
He gestured to two men, holding the assassin's body on a spear.  They took the end and rammed it into a 
wooden block.  The body leaned out slightly over the walls.  Arctur chuckled inside, knowing how much 
of a fool the assassin had been.  Now he had paid the price.  He went back to his speech.  From what he 
could see, it was working to perfection.
</p><p align=left>
Arctur smiled slightly, to try to stir up some enthusiasm.  "But as sad as the day is, the Harmonium must 
get back to the business of keeping the peace.  To do this we need a factol.  I shall leave this choice up to 
the men in the high stations of the faction to decide who shall succeed Sarin.  I know that their wisdom 
shall guide them to the correct decision."  He threw in some extra big and complementary words to fish in 
the poor sods.  From the look on their faces, he knew he had gotten them hook, line, and sinker.
</p><p align=left>
Looking over the crowd, he moved on.  "I still cannot believe what has happened.  Never, in our history, 
has such a crime been committed.  It is unthinkable how someone could commit such a crime and think to 
move on without the slightest bit of remorse of apprehension.  I knew Sarin for 15 years.  He was 
unwavering in his pursuits to bring harmony to all beings.  Never have I met such a finer and more 
dedicated man than him."  That little bit of praise put him a few steps to his destination.  All that was left 
was to drive it home.
</p><p align=left>
"Now, my fellow Cagers, we shall bid our final farewells to our grand Harmonium factol, Sarin."
</p><p align=left>
The Barracks gate opened and a procession with 25 officers, dressed in their very best, on horseback led 
an ornate carriage which contained Sarin's casket.  Many on-lookers threw flowers or notes to him, 
hoping he shall take note of them in the hereafter.  The faces of the men were all somber, many were 
fighting tears with all their might.  But most lost and broke down in unbearable sadness.  And atop the 
carriage, Sarin's wife and two sons, now strong young men, sat crying so much that the size of the Plane 
of Water would have doubled from their tears.
</p><p align=left>
High atop the Barracks roof, the men conversed, sharing their expressions and feelings with each other.  
All except Arctur, that is.  He was making preparations for his appearance at the Mortuary.  He worked to 
bring tears to his eyes to look sad like all the others.  After he accomplished his task, he bid the other 
gentlemen farewell and walked down into the barracks stables to retrieve his horse.  Making sure it was 
covered in black robes, he mounted up and left through the rear gate, taking all the back roads to the 
Mortuary.
</p><p align=left>
He noticed that even in the Hive and Lower Wards, all seemed deadly still.  Even the fiends from the 
Lower Planes where in shock of what happened.  At that moment it dawned on him what he had done.  He 
had managed to stop every world and every wheel from turning, at least for an instant, because the 
impossible was done.  And it also dawned on him how much power he truly possessed.  He was practically 
a living political god.
</p><p align=left>
He arrived at the Mortuary just before the funeral procession did.  Dusting himself off, and finally puling 
out the tears, he was ready for the position of factol.
</p><p align=left>
The procession moved inside the mortuary gates and stopped, shutting the gate behind them.  The strong 
men opened the carriage door and pulled out Sarin's casket, 4 men on each side.  The casket first, all the 
men moved inside, and walked silently through the Dustmen halls.  
</p><p align=left>
Walking into an elaborate room with a large hole in one wall, a priest and 3 acolytes waited for everyone 
to take their seats.  Sarin's casket was put upon a large makeshift altar.
</p><p align=left>
The priest opened his prayer book and began reciting prayers.  During this time, Sarin began thinking of 
what else he would need to do to put himself in that all-powerful position.  He was sure to get the people's 
support, but would it be enough to persuade the high-ups in the faction to put him in Sarin's place?  He 
thought and pondered, but there was nothing else he could do.  He was sure he would get the position.  
Barbithka was a wreck, no one else had his experience, and that little speech of his was incredibly 
moving.  He was the only man for the job.
</p><p align=left>
The priest finished his prayers and nodded to the Dustman standing in the corner.  He touched a crystal 
ball and closed his eyes for a moment.  Then he opened his eyes and stepped over to large contraption 
with many levers.  He pulls some and pushed some and turned a couple of dials.  Then he pulled a large 
level next to the hole in the wall.
</p><p align=left>
The hole lit up with a blue glow and a large table with rolling cylinders came up out of the floor.  The 
men picked up the casket and set it on the large table, and pushed it along towards the hole.  Then they 
stopped and rendered a sharp salute towards their former factol.
</p><p align=left>
The casket entered the hole and there was a flash of light.  After it was gone, so was the casket. 
</p><p align=left>
Looking up just enough to see what was happening, Arctur smiled wickedly and muttered under his 
breath, "Sweet dreams, Sarin."

<p align=left>
We found Bane crawling back to his room in the Inn. Lady Christine was
worried about him. She rattled her bonebox about Bane. When she found his
broken body with us, she immediately rushed to him and healed his wounds. It
was strange that we couldn't see the assailant, even stranger that he did see
him. The blood from his clothes wasn't all his. We walked to the temple to make
sure he was okay. The temple was a temple to the Great Unknown and the priest
examined the blood and found that it was a blood of a tiefling. From Bane's
story, this tiefling could teleport like other fiends used to be able to, but
just recently a band of adventurers stopped the fiends ability to teleport.
Then those adventurers disappeared.  Some say they were put in the dead book,
and others say they escaped to some Prime realm. They say their leader, an
aasimar named Tellaris was turned into a dwarf and is now a leader of the
dwarven people. Hard to believe some of it, others are easy to believe. His
diabolic taint is quite high, he might even be a half-fiend. Bane recovered
well, and was definitely being overly strong to impress the priestess.  He got
himself armored and readies to go kill another fiend, but we hadn't any leads
on the spy. So I was able to talk him into following to Esctasy. If he were
after Bane, he'd follow us.</p><p align=left>

Lady Christine was also a factor, she was able to convince her elders she could
go with us. I was hesitant at first, thinking we would have to protect her. She
was however armored in some plate mail armor, wielding a hammer as her
protection. Bane wore his chain mail, and had a shield and his sword, Derra.
The aasimar, Chandeen joined us as well. He is one of those like myself,  The
warrior priest wore some magical plate mail, and wields a powerful two handed
sword, which is magical as well. Cyrix would have gone but he feared his kind
would try to destroy him. We understood, Cyrix is a good warrior, but we seem
to have quite a few. We went through a gate that sent us into Tradegate, the
border town of Bytopia, Bane led the way, because like the rest of us, he knew
where we were going, the dust and the trail of modrons was easy to trace. The
lady followed close by him, and they would causally flirt, I didn't pay much
attention. I was chatting with Chandeen about the Planes, he has wandered a
number of outer planes, and I have been to a number of the inner planes. I've
been to the plane of air, dust, vapor, earth, and of course the Gray Waste. The
Waste was definitely the worse of my stays.</p><p align=left>

Chandeen was regaling me with stories of Elysium, his home, Bytopia, Mount
Celestia, and the Beastlands. The Beastlands sounded wonderful, the raw
elements fighting over a world of beasts. I will have to visit there sometime.
We were getting closer to the modrons as it was getting darker, but out of the
plains came a group of adventurers. It looked like 8 Warriors being led by a
priest in green and black armor. The priest drew out a mace that was glowing
with an evil aura. The warriors drew their weapons as well. "Christine, stay
back! They're here for me." Bane drew his sword. Uh oh! Bane seems to be a
magnet for trouble. Chandeen and I drew our weapons, and Christine wielded her
mace. Chandeen started to rush forward, but Bane held him back. "We need to
stay together.." He shouted out to the enemy. "Xrist, you ready for another
beating?" The priest's face snarled and the whole group rushed forward. The two
mighty weapons clashed, and I found myself locked in combat with 3 warriors.
Chandeen was handily fighting three warriors. Two were on Christine.</p><p align=left>

The Priest bashed at Bane, and his sword parried all his blows and managed a
strike a blow through Xrist's heavy armor. I slashed my opponents. There were
three of them, but they are only mortal, except for a few of them being
tieflings. I sent magic missiles out to strike my opponents. The creature's
swords struck my skin. My skin!?! HOW DARE THEY!! My sword slashed through one
of the warrior's arm and it slapped to the ground. The other two fought on.
Lady Christine was getting overwhelmed by her opponents and Bane noticed. He
slashed Xrist, and kicked him down. While he was getting up, Bane slashed the
two opponents and they staggered with terrible wounds. Before Christine could
thank him, he started slashing at the evil priest who cast a spell at Bane.
Bane's blows were not striking. Xrist cast another spell and Bane froze. The
priest's foul mace went to strike him. Christine cast a spell and cried out
"NO!" Bane unfroze and parried the mace, and then slashed the evil priest,
sending him sprawling again.</p><p align=left>

Xrist looked at the battle. Chandeen had beaten two of the warriors on him. I
had defeated one, and both of Christine's warriors were pretty beaten. Xrist
yelled, "Where are you bitch! You were supposed to help us!" As I heard this, I
felt a knife blade stick into me. A familiar burning filled my body and it
collapsed, and before my eyes shut, I thought I saw a foul green form above me
with an evil death's smile and a face of a bitch.</p>

It looked as if the battle was joined by an invisible assassin, who has seemed
to kill friend Akon. Bane felled Lady Christine's warriors. "Nedar, you always
did lead with your left. Zax, I'm surprised you survived this long." Ah! These
must be blood warriors who want Bane back, or to kill Bane. A blade slashed
Lady Christine, and she slumped. Bane turned his head to the assassin. He could
see her it seems. "Shara, you will die!" Bane slashed his blade at the
invisible assassin, and it struck. A body fell to the ground. Bane then grabbed
Christine's body. "Christine, please don't die on me. I need you!" Xrist
readied his Mace, but I decided to intercept. "Your little prime Power won't
help you here." The priest snarled "Oh Yeah? Feel the hand of Xvim" A green
magic came out of his hand and struck me. The energy broke my ribs, and slammed
me into the ground. He does have some power. I used Ishtar's magic to heal my
wounds. My ribs started mending, but my limbs couldn't stand. I saw him coming
towards Bane. </p><p align=left>

Bane was not surprised. "Xrist, it's just you and me. You know who will win."
Xrist replied "Yes fight me while your girlfriend dies." Bane grinned "She not
going to die. I healed her."  Yes, Christine was unconscious, but she seemed to
breathe quietly and softly, not wracked with pain. Her wound was gone, he
indeed healed her, but how? Xrist backed up slowly. "You are coming with me."
Xrist cast a spell and a vortex opened up. Xrist jumped through and whispered
another command. Suddenly Bane was being pulled into the vortex. "Christy!!!"
He yelled. The lady's eyes fluttered. I was still paralyzed. If it weren't for
my celestial heritage, I would have died as well. Christine's eyes widened with
shock as she saw Bane, half of his body was in the vortex. She jumped up to try
to grab his arm, but it was too late. He slipped through her grasp and was
gone. Christine lay her head in her hands and wept.</p><p align=left>
